**Information automatically collected when you visit Barnes &. Noble Websites**  
  
When you visit a Barnes &. Noble Website, we automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit such Barnes &. Noble Website.

Noble Website. and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Barnes &. Noble Website. We use this information to monitor the usage of the Barnes &. Noble Websites and as necessary for our business.  
  
**Information collected using cookies**Like many online retailers, we use cookies to recognize you as you use or return to the Barnes &. Noble Websites. This is done so that we can personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. "Cookies" are small files that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on a Barnes &. Noble Website. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you. (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it. (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our marketing efforts and communications. and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners displayed.  
  
Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not be able to place items in a Barnes &. Noble Website shopping bag, and therefore you will not be able to place an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, some Barnes &. Noble Website features and services may not function properly.  
  
_Site Analytics_: We work with a third party service provider to help us better understand how you use the Barnes &. Noble Websites. This third party service provider will place cookies on your computer to collect information. The information this third party service provider collects will tell us things like which search engine referred you to the Barnes &. Noble Website, how you navigated around the Barnes &. Noble Website, what you purchased and what traffic is driven by banner ads and emails. This information will help us to better serve you and provide you with more personalized information and product offerings. We do not allow this third party service provider to collect your credit card information, e-mail address or password information. This third party service provider may only use your personal information to perform services for us. This third party service provider is contractually required to maintain all of the information it collects and analyzes for us securely and in confidence. This third party service provider may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregate, non-personal basis. For more information, view this third party's privacy policy.  
  
Please note that this third party service provider collects data on the Barnes &. Noble Websites using first-party data collection. As a result, blocking cookies from third-party domains will not block these first-party cookies. As a visitor to a Barnes &. Noble Website, you may choose to opt-out of this third party's analysis of your browsing and purchasing behavior on such Barnes &. Noble Website. To opt-out on a Barnes &. Noble Website click here.  
  
**By doing business with or interacting with Barnes &. Noble, you consent to the use of the tracking technologies as described above.**  
  
**Information collected using pixel tags or clear GIFs**  
  
To help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our communications and marketing efforts, we may use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to know if your e-mail program is able to accept HTML e-mails and, if it is, to: (1) send you e-mails in that format. and (2) determine if you have opened our e-mail messages. For this purpose, we tie the pixel tags and clear gifs to personally identifiable information.  
  
**Information collected from Devices or Retail Apps**  
  
When you use a Device or our Retail Apps, we automatically collect information through the Device or Retail App when it is connected to the Internet. For example, we may receive and collect information concerning device registration, settings, usage, firmware version, search queries, downloads, sideloaded content, configuration, and or service information relating to any malfunction of the Device or Retail App.  
  
In addition, to provide location-based services on Devices or through Retail Apps, Barnes &. Noble, NOOK Media and third party application providers may automatically collect geographic location information (including real-time geographic location) or other location-based information about you and your Device or other mobile device on which the Retail App is installed. This information may be used to provide certain device or application functionality or to offer, provide and improve products and services.  
  
For more information about information collected through Devices and Retail Apps, read the Barnes &. Noble Mobile Privacy Supplement.  
  
**Information collected from outside sources**  
  
We may periodically collect personal information and other information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you affirmatively authorize third parties to provide us with information. Such information may be collected via, but not limited to, software applications that you download or use on your Device.  
  
This information may be used for a number of purposes including sending postal mail and e-mail, fulfilling orders, removing repetitive or unnecessary information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing support, customer authentication, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), providing customer service , and processing credit card payments.  
  
**Information collected from visitors from outside the United States**  
  
If you are visiting Barnes &. Noble or a Barnes &. Noble Website from outside the United States and provide us with personal information, please note that your personal information will be transferred, stored and processed within the United States. Additionally, Barnes &. Noble may transfer your personal information to other countries, for example because a server or third party service provider is located there. The data protection and privacy laws of other countries, including the United States, may not afford you the same level of protection as those in your own country. Barnes &. Noble will take appropriate steps to protect your information.  
  
**By doing business or interacting with Barnes &. Noble, you are consenting to the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to and within facilities located in the United States and other facility locations selected by Barnes &. Noble.**

The use of your information by our partners and their vendors and contractors will be subject to the privacy policies of our vendors once such information is transferred.
