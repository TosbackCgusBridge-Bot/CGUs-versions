Flickr Pro Additional Terms of Service

Click here to review the Flickr Gift Purchaser Terms.

1.  **ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF OATH’S ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SERVICE FOR FLICKR PRO**
    
    Welcome to the Flickr Pro service (“Flickr Services”). Oath, which offers Flickr, is part of the Verizon family of companies. The Flickr Services are only available for purchase in U.S. dollars and are offered by Oath’s U.S.-based Flickr service (“Oath”). By using any of the Flickr Services you agree to these Additional Terms of Service (“Additional Terms”) at https://www.flickr.com/atos/services (and any successor pages). The Additional Terms supplement the Oath Terms of Service (“TOS”) at https://policies.oath.com/xw/en/oath/terms/otos/index.html and the Oath Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) located at https://policies.oath.com/xw/en/oath/privacy/intl/index.html (and any successor pages to the TOS and Privacy Policy), both of which are incorporated by reference. You further agree to comply with the Flickr Community Guidelines (“Community Guidelines”) at https://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines/ (and any successor pages), which is incorporated by reference. If there is any conflict between the terms and conditions of these Additional Terms and those in the TOS, the terms and conditions of these Additional Terms will control. Capitalized terms not defined in these Additional Terms have the meanings ascribed to them in the TOS.
    
    Oath reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, these Additional Terms and all documents incorporated by reference. You can always find the most recent version of this Additional Terms and the most recent version of the TOS, Privacy Policy, and the Community Guidelines at the URLs above.
    
    At the end of your subscription term when you have no paid Flickr Services, your account (and all associated data) will revert back to a free Flickr account and you will be governed by the Oath Terms of Service and Privacy Policy you have agreed to when you registered your Oath account (as updated or amended), which may be different from the Oath Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that govern the Flickr Services.

3.  **REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION**
    
    To participate in the Flickr Services, you must provide Oath your credit card number, billing information and other information (“Registration Data”), which will be stored. You agree that the Registration Data is valid, and complete and you will maintain and promptly update that information to keep it valid and complete. If you do not have an account, you will be prompted to register for one before you can pay for a service.
    
    You, and not Oath, are responsible for all purchases (including any unauthorized purchases or errors) made through Oath or in connection with your account. You must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use of your credit card to your credit card company, online payment service provider, merchant, or bank. Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your card issuer’s agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Oath may access, preserve, monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve problems, or to respond to inquiries about any of your Flickr Services, but nothing in this section shall impose a duty on Oath to make any such disclosures.
    
4.  **CONTENT: IP OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE GRANT**
    
    If you agreed to a version of the Oath Terms of Service that was last modified on or after March 23, 2018 (the “New Oath TOS”), the following section applies to you:
    
    These additional terms for Flickr Pro subscribers are in addition to Oath’s Terms of Service and, for Flickr Pro subscribers these terms supersede Oath’s Terms of Service only as to the IP Ownership and License Grant in Section 6(b) of Oath’s Terms of Service. Oath and all of its brands listed in Section 13 of Oath’s Terms of Service (including Oath, AOL, and Flickr brands) and the corporate entities listed in Sections 13 and 14 of Oath’s Terms of Service (collectively, “Oath,” “us,” “we” or “our”) are part of the Verizon family of companies. Our brands, websites, apps, products, services and technologies are referred to as the “Services.”
    
    As a Flickr Pro subscription member, when you upload, share with or submit content including photos and graphics (the “Content”) to the Services, you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that Content. However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Services, you grant Oath the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license: the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Oath removes such Content from the Services. You must have the necessary rights to grant us the license described in this section for any Content that you upload, share with or submit to the Services.
    
    "Publicly accessible" areas of the Services are those areas of the Oath network of properties that are intended by Oath to be available to the general public. By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the Services would include portions of Flickr that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly accessible areas of the Services would not include portions of Flickr that are limited to members, Services intended for private communication such as Oath Mail, or areas off of the Oath network of properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or served by Oath.
    
5.  **PAYMENT, ACCOUNT UPDATER, FRAUD PROTECTIONS AND TERMINATION**
    
    1.  **Payment Terms**
        
        Your credit card will automatically be charged the current fee for the Flickr Service you choose on the date that you click the “Submit order” button in the ordering process. If you do not cancel the Flickr Service you ordered by the end of the current term, your credit card on file will also automatically be charged the then-current fee for that Flickr Service at the commencement of each renewal term. Fees can not be credited towards other services. Current fees are posted on Flickr at https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro. All currency references are in U.S. dollars. Please note, payment for the Service is non-refundable, unless Oath expressly provides otherwise. To cancel the Service visit https://flickr.com/account/wallet. If you cancel you will continue to keep the service until the end of your subscription term.
        
    2.  **Account Updater**
        
        As a convenience to its users, Oath may subscribe to a third party service that can attempt to refresh expired credit card or debit card numbers with the numbers of replacement cards so that users’ paid services do not lapse because the payment instrument initially on file with Oath has expired (“Account Updater”). By buying a Flickr Service, you consent to Oath’s disclosure of your registration information to this third party service and to that service’s use of such information solely in connection with Account Updater. You also consent to Oath’s receipt and use of updated credit card or debit card account information from your financial institution in connection with the provision of the service as provided in the TOS, these Additional Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Community Guidelines.
        
    3.  **Fraud Protections**
        
        To protect against fraud, Oath may verify the credit card information you provide. The verification process may include debiting an amount between $0.00 and $1.00 from your credit card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit card. Oath will only use this process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the Service. By providing Oath with your credit card information, you authorize Oath to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than or equal to one dollar for such verification purposes.
        
    4.  **Termination**
        
        If your credit card is invalid for any reason, your account will revert to a free Flickr account and will be subject to the limitations of a free Flickr account. provided, however, that Oath reserves the right to cancel your account entirely in such case, whereupon all the information and content contained within it will be deleted permanently. Oath accepts no liability for data that is deleted due to an invalid credit card.
        
6.  **AGE REQUIREMENTS**
    
    The Flickr Services are available for individuals 13 or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to these terms and conditions.
