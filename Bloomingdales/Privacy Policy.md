3\. Interest-Based or Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) (ADV, OPS)

*   For additional information on interest-based advertising and options for managing preferences, click here. 

  
4\. Social Network &. New Tech Advertising Programs (ADV)

These companies have specific Interest-Based Ads programs that match people that have shown interest in Bloomingdale's through our website or other services with their profiles (such as on Facebook) and platforms (such as Facebook and Google properties).  This matching allows us to deliver relevant, interest-based ads on those companies' networks.
*   To get information about managing your preferences for these programs, click here.

*   Bloomingdale's does not currently recognize and process Do Not Track signals from different web browsers.

6\. Bloomingdale's Mobile Applications (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)  

*   Bloomingdale's offers mobile applications that you may download from your phone or smart device's "app store" as well as apps that you can download from your Internet-connected devices (e.g., smart television).  
*   Bloomingdale's mobile applications, with your permission, may use your device's camera, microphone, or location information to enable features or services.  For example, geolocation (e.g., GPS) can help you find a nearby store or learn about upcoming nearby store events. Another example is in-store location using Bluetooth signals to connect to our beacons or our in-store Wi-Fi services, which can help you while inside our store to find nearby products or receive real-time offers.
*   Bloomingdale's mobile application preferences are managed in the Bloomingdale's application and through your device's settings.

  
7\. Beacons (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)  

*   Beacons are small appliances that we use to enhance and make the Bloomingdale's in-store experience more interactive. Beacons broadcast a Bluetooth signal that can be received by Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as a mobile phone, when those devices are within proximity of a beacon. Beacons do not collect or pull in personal data. they only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices, much in the same way radar works. In-app permissions, such as permission to access location and accept push notifications (sometimes shown as 'PNS' on your devices), must be enabled for a beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device. Interactions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from Bloomingdale's as well as other non-Bloomingdale's applications and advertisers.
*   Beacon Preferences are managed through your device (Bluetooth, Location, and PNS settings).

  
8\. In-Store Wi-Fi Services (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)  

*   Many Bloomingdale's locations offer free Wi-Fi services to visitors. Wi-Fi routers capture certain data from devices that interact with the router. Some examples of data automatically collected through our Wi-Fi service include:
*   Information about your device, including a MAC address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service.
*   Vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores.
*   Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.

  
9\. RFID (FUL, OPS, SEC)  

*   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects. RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data. Bloomingdale's uses RFID for inventory management (such as locating shoes in the stock room) and logistics support. RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.

  
10\. Video Cameras (FUL, OPS, SEC)  

*   We use cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection. We also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as traffic pattern analysis. Cameras may include technology to capture demographic information, such as age, gender and dwell time.   
*   We will not use cameras to personally identify you, without your consent, except when the identification is for security, anti-theft, or law enforcement purposes.

  
11\. Voice-Enabled Services (FUL, OPS)  

*   We may use voice-enabled services (VES) to provide you greater functionality and easier shopping experiences with services such as voice search for products (for e.g., "Show me Style &.

Voice files are not used to personally identify an individual and will not be associated within any individual Bloomingdale's account.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act imposes requirements on Web sites that collect personal information about children under 13 years old (for example - name, address, email address, social security number, etc.).

For this reason, our sweepstakes and other promotions conducted online are restricted to entrants who are at least 13 years old.  
If this policy changes, we will revise this portion of our Notice of Privacy Practices and will comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which includes providing notice and choice to each child's parent or guardian before collecting any personal information.
