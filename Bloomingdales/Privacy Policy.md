*   Bloomingdale's offers mobile applications that you may download from your phone or smart device's "app store" as well as apps that you can download from your Internet-connected devices (e.g., smart television).

7\. Beacons (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)  

*   Beacons are small appliances that we use to enhance and make the Bloomingdale's in-store experience more interactive. Beacons broadcast a Bluetooth signal that can be received by Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as a mobile phone, when those devices are within proximity of a beacon. Beacons do not collect or pull in personal data. they only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices, much in the same way radar works. In-app permissions, such as permission to access location and accept push notifications (sometimes shown as 'PNS' on your devices), must be enabled for a beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device. Interactions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from Bloomingdale's as well as other non-Bloomingdale's applications and advertisers.
*   Beacon Preferences are managed through your device (Bluetooth, Location, and PNS settings).

  
8\. In-Store Wi-Fi Services (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)

*   Information about your device, including a MAC address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service.
*   Vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores.
*   Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.

  
9\. RFID (FUL, OPS, SEC)  

*   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects. RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data. Bloomingdale's uses RFID for inventory management (such as locating shoes in the stock room) and logistics support. RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.

  
10\. Video Cameras (FUL, OPS, SEC)  

*   We use cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection. We also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as traffic pattern analysis. Cameras may include technology to capture demographic information, such as age, gender and dwell time.

Safeguarding Information  
Bloomingdale's has put various procedural, technical, and administrative measures in place to safeguard the information we collect and use. We designed our technology-enabled services to accept orders only from Web and mobile browsers that permit communication through a Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL is an encryption standard that provides a layer of security while information is being transmitted over the Internet.  
As a matter of policy, we do not disclose details regarding our security measures as this could be beneficial information to criminals and other bad actors.  
Be advised, no security safeguards or standards are guaranteed to provide 100% security. You should always use appropriate self-protection measures and practice safe browsing on all websites. For more information on how you can securely shop with us, please review our Security Tips by clicking here.  The National Cybersecurity Alliance also provides comprehensive information to stay safe online.  
Additionally, sometimes bad actors attempt to use our brand to create fake web pages, send fake texts or emails, and conduct other illegal activities to commit fraud or attempt to breach consumers' security.  We actively monitor for these illegal scams and shams. We provide FAQs and Consumer Protection Alerts in our Customer Protection Center (CPC) as we learn of these activities. If you receive anything with the Bloomingdale's brand that seems suspicious, you can check to see if there is an alert on the CPC or call our customer service department.
