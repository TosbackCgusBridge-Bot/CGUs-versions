**  
Data Protection Policy**

Thank you for visiting our website. The protection and  
confidentiality of your personal data is of particular importance for  
StepStone.

In this document we will inform you about the processing  
of personal data in connection with the services we offer at www.stepstone.com  
and other websites or apps (collectively referred to as  
“Platforms”) that incorporate this Data Protection Policy. Personal  
data comprises all information that relates to an identified or identifiable  
natural person (Article 4 (1) GDPR). This includes information such as your  
name, e-mail address, postal address, or telephone number. Information that is  
not directly associated with your identity, e.g. the number of users of an  
Internet site, does not fall within this scope.

**1.** **Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?**

The data controller  
(hereinafter referred to as “StepStone” or “we”) in the  
sense of the General Data Protection Regulation and other national data  
protection laws of the member states as well as other data protection  
regulations is:

3.       
Purposes  
and legal basis of the data processing and period for which data will be stored in the  
context of a general use of our Platforms and services

In the following we inform you  
about the different purposes for which we process personal data, on which legal  
basis such processing takes place, and for how long we store the data.

Insofar as we obtain the  
consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art. 6 (1) (a) EU  
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the legal basis for the processing  
of personal data. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the  
performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) (b)  
GDPR will be the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations  
required to carry out pre-contractual actions. If processing of personal data  
is required to fulfill a legal obligation that our company is subject to, Art.  
6 (1) (c) GDPR is the legal basis. If processing is necessary to safeguard the  
legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests,  
fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the  
first interest, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR is the legal basis for processing.

The personal data of the data  
subject will be stored for as long as the purpose continues.

**3.1** **General access to our  
Platforms**

With each access to our Platforms, we  
automatically collect data and information from the accessing device and store  
this data and information in the log files of the server. We may collect (1)  
the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the  
accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our  
website (known as referrers), (4) the sub-web pages that are accessed on our  
website (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet  
protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the  
accessing system and (8) other similar data and information used to defend any  
attacks **against** our IT systems. For security purposes, i.e. to be able to reconstruct an  
eventual attack against our Platforms, we store such data including the IP  
address for 14 days and then anonymize or delete such data. The IP address is  
required during the connection to transfer the contents of our Platform to your  
device. The legal basis for the processing and storage of the IP address is a  
legitimate interest as per Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest for  
the transmission of the IP address is that it is required to display the  
contents of the website. without transmission of the IP address it is not  
possible to display the content of the Platform. The legimtiate interest for  
the temporary storage are our security interests.

**3.2** **Optimization  
of search and recommendation functions**

We may also store information  
about your usage patterns on our Platforms in order to create statistical  
models to make our Platforms more user-friendly and, in particular, to optimize  
the functionalities to search for and recommend suitable job advertisements. In  
this context we also save your IP address in a pseudonymized form (that means  
that a natural person can no longer be identified based purely on the  
information in the statistical model) to exclude automated accesses (bots) to our  
Platforms when creating the statistical models. Legal basis for this purpose is  
Art. 6 (1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to ensure the functionality of the  
statistical model to improve our services. The IP address is deleted after one  
year.

**3.3** **Objections to marketing**  
If you raise an objection with us against marketing purposes, we may put your  
personal contact information (name, address, telephone number, fax number,  
e-mail address) on a blacklist to ensure that we no longer send you any  
unwanted marketing material. The legal basis is a legitimate interest within  
the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, where the legitimate interest is that we  
can meet our obligations from your objection against marketing. The data will  
be stored for this purpose until you expressly withdraw the objection to  
marketing in writing.

**3.4** **StepStone surveys**

StepStone organizes market surveys from time to  
time. As part of such surveys we will not collect any personal data, but at the  
end of the survey we might offer you the opportunity to participate in a  
competition. In order to participate in the competition you will have to  
provide us with your e-mail address, which we will only use for the purpose of  
the competition to notify you if you have won a prize. In particular, the  
e-mail address will be stored completely separately from your answers to the  
survey. The legal basis for the storage of your email address is your consent  
under Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. We will store your email address for this purpose  
until the end of the respective competition.

In this context we use Easyfeedback GmbH,  
Ernst-Abbe-Straße 4, 56070 Koblenz, Germany as data processor. They provide the  
platform on which the surveys take place. Easyfeedback uses Strato AG,  
Pascalstraße 10, 10587 Berlin, Germany as host provider and Zeusware GmbH,  
Grünauer Str. 201-209, 12557 Berlin, Germany, for the server management as  
additional processors, so that these are recipients of data. In any case they  
only process the data according to our instructions.

**3.5** **Contact  
form and e-mail contact**

Our Platforms provide contact  
forms that can be used to contact us electronically. By clicking the  
“Send” button, you consent to the transmission to us of the data  
entered in the input form. In addition, we save the date and time of your contact.  
Alternatively, contact via the e-mail address provided is possible. In this  
case, the user’s personal data transmitted along with e-mail and our  
response will be stored. The personal data voluntarily transmitted to us in  
this context is used to process your inquiry and to contact you as needed. The  
legal basis for the transmission of the data is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. The data  
will be used for this purpose until the specific conversation with you has  
ended. The conversation will be deemed ended when it can be inferred from the  
circumstances that the relevant facts have been conclusively clarified.

**3.6** **Facebook****  
Connect**  
With Facebook Connect, you can use your Facebook  
account to open a new MyStepStone account at StepStone or to connect to a  
MyStepStone account. If you create a MyStepStone account via Facebook or log in  
to an existing MyStepStone account via Facebook, we will gain access to your  
public profile and your e-mail address. We use this information to pre-populate  
or update your MyStepStone account at StepStone and then provide you with the  
MyStepStone account. Since we use your Facebook data to create a MyStepStone  
account, the legal basis is the contract for the MyStepStone account pursuant  
to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. We store your personal data for as long as necessary to  
provide the contractually agreed service. The personal data stored by you in  
your “MyStepStone” account is available to you for the duration of  
the contract and will be stored by us for this period. The personal data will  
be erased if you do so in relation to individual data or ask us to do so or if  
the contract ends, that is, if you or we terminate the contract, further  
details are available in the terms of use.

**3.7** **Use  
of data processors for hosting and securing our platforms, administrative,  
troubleshooting, and support services**

We use data processors, which  
we list below, to provide our services. The legal basis for using these data  
processors is legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate  
interest lies in the execution of our business activities, particularly to  
provide the services described elsewhere in this Data Protection Policy. No  
conflicting interest is apparent because we have entered into a data processing  
agreement with the respective processors under Art. 28 GDPR.

**3.7.1** **Hosting**

We use data processors to host  
our Platforms and for back-up services, meaning that personal data that is  
stored on our platforms is transferred to these data processors. These data  
processors are Amazon Webservices, Inc., 410 Terry Drive Ave North, WA  
98109-5210 Seattle, USA (who processes data solely in the EU), StepStone GmbH,  
Axel-Springer-Str. 65, 10969 Berlin, Germany, StepStone Continental Europe  
GmbH, Völklinger Straße 1, 40219 Düsseldorf, Germany and StepStone N.V.,  
Koningsstraat 47 Rue Royale, 1000 Brussels Belgium. These data processors will  
store the data for the same duration as it is stored on our Platforms for the  
various purposes defined in this Data Protection Policy.

**3.7.2** **Administrative,  
troubleshooting, and support services**

We use StepStone Services sp. z  
o.o., ul. Domaniewska 50, 02-672 Warsaw, Poland, for administrative,  
troubleshooting, and support services, and which may consequently also have  
access to your personal data. Generally StepStone Services sp. z o.o should not  
store any personal data. This will only be done in exceptional cases, e.g. if  
needed to rectify technical issues. In such cases personal data will only be  
stored to the extent and for the duration that is necessary.

**3.7.3** **Sending of e-mails and other messages**

For the sending of e-mails and  
messages through other electronic channels we use the services of Selligent  
GmbH, Atelierstraße 12, 81671 Munich, Germany, as a data processor, who in turn  
uses the following subcontractors

–         
Selligent Benelux NV, Kempische Steenweg, 305 box  
401 Belgium

–         
Selligent International, Avenue de Finlande 2 box 2, 1420  
Braine-L’Alleud, Belgium

–         
Selligent France SA, 20 Place des Vins de France RCS, 75012 Paris,  
France

–         
Selligent SA, 1420 Braine-l’Alleud, 2 avenue de Finlande, Belgium

–         
Selligent Iberica S.L.U, Caille Enrique Granados 86-88, Planta 3 °, 0008  
Barcelona, ​​Spain

–         
Selligent Ltd, Second Floor, 45 Folgate Street, London E1 6GL, United  
Kingdom

Accordingly, these parties may  
also be provided with your personal data in the course of data processing  
commissioned by us. It will be stored there for a period that is otherwise  
lawful for purposes under this Data Protection Policy, i.e. in particular for  
the contractual communications in the course of contracts with you or otherwise  
for promotional communications.

The legal basis for our use of  
Selligent is a legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 f GDPR, namely  
the execution of our business purposes in the course of the processes described  
elsewhere in this Data Protection Policy. No conflicting interest is apparent  
in this respect, in particular due to the fact that we have entered into a data  
processing agreement with Selligent.

**3.7.4** **Proxy caching and web application firewall**

We  
use Akamai Technologies GmbH, Parkring 20-22, 85748 Garching, Germany and  
Akamai Technologies, Inc., 150 Broadway, Cambridge, 02142 MA, USA as data  
processors for the purposes of proxy caching and web application firewall  
services. That means that any visit to our websites is routed through the  
servers of Akamai, meaning that the user will not be connected directly to our  
servers but to those of Akamai and Akamai will then request the content from  
our servers and will deliver it to the user. Proxy caching in this context  
means that Akamai will cache selected content (but not personal data) for a  
period of 24 hours, so that this can be delivered faster to you. The web  
application firewall means that Akamai will try to identify malicious web  
traffic and will prevent it from accessing our websites. Akamai does not store  
any personal data, but any dataflows between our servers and the user will be  
routed through Akamai, so that this can also include personal data. Data  
transferred to Akamai Technologies, Inc is transferred outside the EU and the  
EEA. This is permissible under Art. 45 GDPR because Akamai Technologies, Inc is  
Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of protection exists  
according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU) 2016/1250  
(http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE).  
The certification can be viewed at  
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000Gn4RAAS&status=Active.

With respect to Akamai, the  
additional legitimate interest in the context of the legal basis is that we  
thereby are also implementing technical and organizational measures to protect  
our Platforms and the personal data stored on them.

**3.8** **Google  
Re-Captcha**

In  
specific cases we use the reCAPTCHA service  
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/ by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater  
Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”) based on a  
legitimate interest (i.e. the interest to ensure the correctness of data,  
avoidance of automatic registrations / orders by so-called bots, and economical  
operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR).

Google  
is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus warrants that it  
complies with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).

We use re-Captcha to  
distinguish whether an input is made by a human or abusively by automated,  
mechanical processing. The query in this context includes the sending of the IP  
address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to  
Google. Your input will be transmitted to Google and analyzed for this purpose.

For more information about  
Google reCAPTCHA and Google’s Data Protection Policy, please visit the  
following links: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and  
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android. html.

**3.9** **Youtube** **videos  
**  
In the context of a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 GDPR,  
namely an attractive design of our websites, we use the YouTube for the  
integration of videos. YouTube is operated by YouTube LLC, headquartered at 901  
Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube is represented by Google Inc.,  
located at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.  
On some of our websites we use plugins from YouTube. If you access our websites  
with such a plug-in – for example a media library – a connection to  
the YouTube servers will be established and the plugin will be displayed. It  
will then be communicated to the YouTube server which of our websites you have  
visited. If you are logged in as a member of YouTube, YouTube can assign this  
information to your personal user account. When using the plugin, e.g. by  
clicking on the start button of a video, Youtube can also assign this  
information to your user account. You can prevent this by logging out of your  
YouTube user account and other user accounts of the YouTube LLC and Google Inc.  
before using our website and deleting the corresponding cookies from the  
companies.

**3.10** **Cookies and similar technology**

We use cookies on our  
websites. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer system via an  
Internet browser. We use such cookies both as a technical means of providing  
services on our Platforms as well as for analyzing the website behavior of our  
visitors and on that basis developing a more user-friendly design of our  
offerings. For this purpose, we may also use other techniques, such as tracking  
pixels or code in apps. In addition, we may use these cookies or other techniques  
to target you with interesting job advertisements and other content.

Some of the cookies we use are  
deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e. when you close your browser  
(known as session cookies). Other cookies are kept on your end device and enable  
us or our partner companies to recognize your browser on the next visit  
(persistent cookies).

If not specifically stated  
below, you can view the exact retention period of a given cookie by displaying  
the cookie in your browser.

You can set your browser up  
such that you are notified when a cookie is set and can decide individually  
whether to accept them or whether you opt out of accepting cookies for specific  
cases or generally. If you opt out of accepting cookies, the functionality of  
our website may be limited. We deal with specific cookies or similar technology  
below.

**3.10.1** **Technically necessary cookies**

We use technical cookies. These  
are cookies that are merely required to collect certain information on our  
Platforms to provide a service required or wanted by you as user. This extends  
to navigation or session cookies that enable smooth navigation and use of the  
website (and for instance permit access to the restricted area). analysis  
cookies that are set directly by us to collect aggregated information about the  
number of users and their behavior. functional cookies that provide you with  
navigation by certain selected criteria as part of a service optimization (e.g.  
selected language, purchase of selected products).

The legal basis for these  
cookies is a legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 f GDPR, namely  
pursuance of our business purposes.

**3.10.2** **Cookies  
and technologies that we use via third party providers**

We also use cookies or other  
technology provided to us by external providers in various areas. In the  
following, we inform you about the respective providers and how you can object  
to the cookie or the corresponding technology. In general, in the case of  
websites, you can make an appropriate setting in your browser and in case of  
our apps you can make the respective setting with the slider for anonymous  
statistics under "Settings".

**(1)** **Firebase**

In our apps we use technology  
from Google Firebase (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA  
94043, USA, "Google") with various functionalities.

Firebase Analytics enables  
the analysis of the use of our apps. This completely anonymized information  
about the use of our app is collected and transmitted to Google and stored  
there. Google uses the advertising ID of the device. Google will use this  
information to evaluate the use of our app and to provide us with other  
services related to the use of apps. In Device Settings, you can restrict the  
use of the Advertising ID (iOS: Privacy / Advertising / No Ad Tracking,  
Android: Account / Google / View). Google Analytics for Firebase (Google Inc.).  
We also use Firebase Remote Config, which allows us to run A / B tests and  
customize the behavior and appearance of the app without having to download a  
new version. Personal data is not stored.

Google Inc. is certified  
under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with  
European privacy legislation  
(https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).  
Subcontractors that Google can use can be found here:  
https://firebase.google.com/terms/subprocessors.

The legal basis for the use  
of data analysis and the use of Firebase is a legitimate interest (ie interest  
in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our apps) within the  
meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

You can opt-out of using  
Firebase at any time by changing the setting of the slider for anonymous  
statistics in the app under "Settings”.

**(2)** **Google Conversion Tracking**

On the grounds of our  
legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and  
economical operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)  
(f) GDPR), we use the marketing and remarketing services (for short:  
“Google Marketing Services”) of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre  
Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).

Google is certified under the  
Privacy Shield Agreement and thus warrants that it complies with European  
privacy legislation  
(https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).

The Google Marketing Services  
enable us to display advertisements for and on our website in a more targeted  
manner to so that users are only shown advertisements that they may be  
interested in. If a user sees e.g. advertisements for products that he or she  
was interested in on other websites, this is referred to as  
“remarketing”. For this purpose, when our websites and other  
websites are accessed on which Google Marketing Services are active, Google  
directly executes a Google code and what are termed (re)marketing tags  
(invisible graphics or code, also known as “web beacons”) are  
integrated into the website. These are used to store an individual cookie, i.e.  
a small file on the user’s device (comparable technologies may also be  
used instead of cookies). The cookies may be set by various domains, including  
google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com,  
googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com. This file records which  
websites the user searches for, the content he or she is interested in and  
which offers he or she has clicked. It also stores technical information on the  
browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit, and other  
information on the use of the online offering. Similarly, the user’s IP  
address is recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we state that  
the IP address is shortened in within Member States of the European Union or in  
other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in  
exceptional cases is it transferred in full to a Google server in the USA and  
shortened there. The IP address is not merged with the user’s data within  
other Google offerings. Google may also combine the above information with  
information from other sources. If the user subsequently visits other websites,  
tailored advertisements can be displayed depending on his or her interests.

The user’s data is  
processed in a pseudonimyzed form as part of the Google Marketing Services.  
This means that Google stores and processes e.g. not the user’s name or  
e-mail address, but instead processes the relevant data based on the cookie  
within pseudonymized user profiles. This means that, from Google’s  
perspective, the advertisements are not managed and displayed for a  
specifically identifiable person, but for the holder of the cookie, irrespective  
of who the holder of this cookie is. This does not apply if a user has  
expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.  
The information about the user collected by Google Marketing Services is  
transferred to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the USA.

The Google Marketing Services  
deployed by us include the “Google AdWords” online advertising  
program. Google AdWords supplies every AdWords customer with a different  
“conversion cookie”. This means that cookies cannot be traced via  
the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained using the cookie  
enables conversion statistics for AdWords customers to be produced who have  
opted for conversion tracking. The AdWords customers are notified of the total  
number of users who clicked their advertisement and were forwarded to a page  
containing a conversion tracking tag. However, they are not given any  
information that could be used to personally identify users.

We may involve third parties  
on the basis of the “DoubleClick” Google marketing services.  
DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to place  
advertisements on the basis of users’ visits to this website and other  
websites on the Internet.

Additionally, we may deploy  
the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage the Google  
analytics and marketing service within our website.

For  
further information on data usage for marketing purposes by Google, refer to  
the overview page: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/advertisements;  
Google’s privacy policy can be accessed at  
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy.

If you would like to opt out  
of interest-driven advertising from Google Marketing Services, you can use the  
settings and opt-out options provided by Google: http://www.google.com/advertisements/preferences.

**(3)** **Tealium Audience Stream**

We use the “Tealium  
Audience Stream”, a service by Tealium Inc., 11085 Torreyana Road, San  
Diego, CA 92121, USA (Tealium) within our website. This collects and stores  
data that we use to create pseudonymized user profiles. On our behalf, Tealium  
will use this information to structure your use of the website in line with  
your needs automatically and in real time and to display advertising. For this  
purpose, information including the following is collected: viewed and clicked  
advertisements, articles, advertising, visitor numbers, subject matter of the  
page, etc.

The pseudonymized user  
profiles are not merged with personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym  
without consent, which must be provided separately. Similarly, the IP address  
transmitted by your browser is not merged with the usage profiles.

Cookies are used is used to  
create the usage profiles, or similar technology for mobile end devices. The  
information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is stored  
exclusively in Germany. You can prevent the storage of the cookies by making a  
corresponding setting in your browser software. however, please note that if  
you do so you may not be able to use all functions of this website fully.

You may opt out of the data  
collection and storage for the purposes of web analysis and the placement of  
advertisements with future effect by following the instructions on  
http://tealium.com/de/privacy/.

The legal basis is a  
legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 f GDPR, namely pursuance of our  
business purposes.

**(4)** **Tealium iQ (Tag Management System)**

This website uses a Tag  
Management System (TMS), a service from Tealium Inc., 11085 Torreyana Road, San  
Diego, CA 92121, USA (Tealium), for the dynamic customization of parts of the  
website. To enable this functionality, a cookie called utag\_main is set. The  
TMS is needed for us to provide our services and can therefore not be  
deactivated. The cookie has a term of twelve months.

Data transferred to Tealium is transferred to the USA and  
thus to a country outside the EU and the EEA. This is permissible under Art. 45  
GDPR because Tealium is Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of  
protection exists according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU)  
2016/1250  
(http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE).
