We also use analytic software, such as Google Analytics and others, to help us to better understand how our websites and Apps function on your device and for research and development. We may use third party platforms to help us promote interest-based advertisements to you, we may use web tracking tools as described above or a process called hashing, which involves converting the e-mail address, phone number or other contact information you have provided to us into a unique value that these platforms may compare to a unique value created on their platforms. You have options when it comes to cookies and other web tracking tools.

You can set your browser or device to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features or services may not function properly without cookies. Some browsers support a “Do Not Track” feature, which is intended to be a signal to websites that you do not wish to be tracked across different websites you visit. Our websites do not currently change the way they operate based upon detection of a Do Not Track or similar signal. As the internet and other e-commerce channels continue to develop, we may deploy and utilize different types of technologies to collect data regarding your visit or usage.

We may retain your information for as long as necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was originally collected and any other legitimate business purpose, including, for legal, archival, accounting, and/or audit purposes.

**Personal Location Information** .

We use information about your location (including, at times, by linking personal information with location information of the rental vehicle you are using) primarily to locate our nearest rental location, send you location-based notifications (_i.e_., nearby special offers), arrival and return notifications, vehicle location, and upgrade availabilities. We also use information about your location for the same purposes we use your personal information, including to provide you with, and improve, relevant marketing or offers from us and our partners.

We may retain your information for as long as you have an account with Avis, Budget or Budget Truck Rental as needed to provide you our services, or as otherwise necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was originally collected and any other legitimate business purpose, including, for legal, archival, accounting, and/or audit purposes. If you close your account or request we provide you our services, we may retain your information because we have a legal, auditing or account obligations or it is in our archive system and cannot be separated from other information.

If you are under 18 years old in California, in certain circumstances, you may request and obtain removal of personal information or content shared by you and posted on our Website or App. Please be mindful that this would not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on our Website or App by you.

If we do so, we will take reasonable steps to ensure your information is treated and protected no less securely than it is in the United States. This Privacy Notice is intended to be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey and meet the laws and requirements of the United States, which may not necessarily be consistent with the laws and regulations of the country where you live.

ABG is not responsible for the compliance of the independent location with privacy laws. However, if you believe the independent location is violating privacy laws, you may report this to ABG’s Global Privacy Office at ABGprivacy@avisbudget.com.
