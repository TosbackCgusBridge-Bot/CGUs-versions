Policy

Thank you for helping us keep Gratipay users safe! We ask that all researchers:

*   Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing;
*   Perform research only within the scope set out below;
*   Review our Severity: None disclosures to avoid filing unwanted reports;
*   Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us;
*   Report vulnerabilities as soon as you discover them. and
*   Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and Gratipay until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

*   Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
*   Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission).

⚠️ Please note that, as an open organization , our policy is to fully disclose all resolved, informative, and not applicable issues, in the interest of openness and transparency for our customers.

Scope

*   https://gratipay.com
*   https://grtp.co (not in scope for clickjacking)
*   gratipay-bot
*   postgres.py
*   environment.py

We target an "A" grade on SSLLabs for both grtp.co and gratipay.com , and consider it a low risk if we drop below that.

Out of Scope

In the interest of the safety of our users, staff, the Internet at large and you as a security researcher, the following test types are excluded from scope:

*   Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating).
*   Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing).
*   Findings from applications or systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section.
*   Vulnerability reports with video only PoCs.
*   Reports that state that software is out of date/vulnerable without a proof of concept.
*   Highly speculative reports about theoretical damage. Be concrete.
*   Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they're an issue.
*   Reports from automated web vulnerability scanners (Acunetix, Vega, etc.) that have not been validated.
*   Recently disclosed 0day vulnerabilities. We need time to patch our systems just like everyone else - please give us 30 days before reporting these types of issues.
*   Issues in third-party services should be reported to the respective team. Please take a look at the "Third-party Services" section for more information.

⚠️ The following issue types are excluded from scope:

*   Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities.
*   Low severity issues that can be detected with tools such as Hardenize and SecurityHeaders.io .
*   XSS issues that affect only outdated browsers .
*   Content injection issues.
*   Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) with minimal security implications (Logout CSRF, etc.).
*   Missing cookie flags on non-security-sensitive cookies.
*   UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes.
*   CSV injection .
*   401 injection .
*   Stack traces that disclose information. We are open source so most of this information is already out there.
*   Host header issues without an accompanying proof-of-concept demonstrating vulnerability.
*   Open ports without an accompanying proof-of-concept demonstrating vulnerability.
*   Banner grabbing issues (figuring out what web server we use, etc.).

⚠️ Things we do not want to receive:

*   Personally identifiable information (PII)
*   Credit card holder data
*   Duplicates of reports we've already identified as Severity: None

Reporting

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms, please send it to us on HackerOne.

Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If a report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, it will not be eligible for a bounty. We also ask you to cite references and not to copy/paste entire reports. Reports copied entirely or mostly from elsewhere will not be eligible for a bounty.

We especially appreciate reports containing the affected code from our GitHub repository , and possibly even patches, and we encourage you to test our platform by setting up Gratipay locally . That way you can test all sorts of payloads to your heart's content.
