Privacy Policy

Last modified on: December 17th 2014

Connexity is committed to consumer privacy and relevant advertising in support of a safe, free Internet experience. Similar to television, radio, newspapers and magazines, most of the content and services you enjoy online are advertising supported, that is why you do not have to pay a subscription to use them. Our goal is to continuously improve the online experience by improving the relevance of advertising in support of free content. Most people agree, given that advertising is here to stay, it should be more relevant to your interests.

Connexity is at the forefront of making advertising more interesting through audience technology. That’s you, the audience, but we don’t know who you are. We do our best to match ads to your individual interests, but always in an anonymous way. We don’t use personal or sensitive information like name, email address or phone number. To us, you are just a random number, a reference to a browser on a particular computer or other interactive device.

The cornerstone of any relationship is trust, and we believe that full transparency is the only way to earn your trust. Connexity is a new breed of interactive media company, incorporating privacy by design and enhanced notice from inception. We intend to earn your trust by providing details about what we do, how we do it and the choices available to you.

Insights powered by Bizrate users, please see the privacy policy found here.

What we do and why we collect data

Connexity conducts business with advertisers (those who sell products and services, create the ads and buy the ad space) and publishers (those who provide the free content and services and sell the ad space). We are an intermediary in this process. Given lots of ads and lots of ad space, we provide technology that strives to match up the ads with the ad space and deliver the best ad at the best time. We improve performance for the advertiser and the publisher by reducing the clutter of ads that are not interesting to you.

Our approach to this is based on many variables, most of which involve the collection of data from things like IP address, browser settings and browsing activity on the websites we work with (the network). The data is individualized to provide the best user experience through the most relevant ads, but remains strictly anonymous, confidential, and is never reviewed by a person. All of our technology uses computer algorithms to match ads to audience. We target these audiences directly or make them available to third parties. Aggregate data is shared in report format with our clients as a normal course of business.

How we collect data

We only collect data from websites we have a business relationship with. We anonymously collect data over time and across the network. We also use anonymous data from third party data providers who are contractually obligated to adhere to comparable privacy principles. This additional anonymous data is used to improve our audience database and make ads more interesting to you.

Connexity uses a number of common technologies to identify devices that have been on the network before. These include HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, browser cache and entity tags. These are collectively called “persistence files” and are only used to synchronize the browser session with our server-side audience database. When you voluntarily Opt-Out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertising from Connexity, we also use these persistence tools to maintain your Opt-Out state indefinitely.

What data we collect

All audience data is anonymous, and relates to a device rather than a person. Connexity collects a number of types of anonymous session data including approximate geographic location from IP address, browser type, primary language, websites visited, ads clicked on and actions taken with our advertising partners. Additionally, if you access the network from a mobile device, we may collect a unique device identifier, device type, carrier and location information if you have opted in and chosen to share that data with your carrier or a mobile application. We retain collected data for up to 10 years, and aggregated data indefinitely, to continuously improve our technology and services.

What data we DO NOT collect

**Connexity does not collect, buy, sell, share or use Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about consumers such as name, address, telephone number, email address, or any other data used, or intended to be used, to identify or contact a person.** The only PII we collect is done in the normal course of business directly on this website from advertisers and publishers who are our clients.

Regarding the websites and products you encounter while browsing the Internet, you should read each of their privacy policies to learn how they collect and use data. If you choose to provide personally identifiable information to an advertiser or publisher who participates in our network, that information is not shared with Connexity.

Consumer choice

Connexity adheres to the principles of the IAB Member Code of Conduct. To Opt-Out of only Connexity behavioral targeting, please click on the Opt-Out link at right.

It is important to understand that opting out does not mean you will no longer see ads. It means ads will no longer be selected based on your interests. **If you Opt-Out, you may receive _more_ advertising and it may be _less interesting_ to you. You can Opt back in at any time.**

Connexity also participates in the Enhanced Notice program of the Digital Advertising Alliance and adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA). When required, the program utilizes a clickable icon for behaviorally targeted ads providing both transparency and choice. It links to information about how the ad was targeted, as well as ways to Opt-Out. Participating associations for this program include:

Connexity’s compliance with self-regulation can be monitored by one of several OBA compliance providers at the client’s discretion.
