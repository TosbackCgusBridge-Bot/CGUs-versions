1\. **Wireless Connectivity**

**Use of Wireless Connectivity.** Your Kindle uses wireless connectivity to allow you to shop for and download Digital Content. Some Kindle devices may require you to purchase a data plan from a third party in order to receive and use wireless connectivity. In such case, your wireless connectivity is subject to the fees, restrictions and limitations imposed by the wireless provider. In addition, if your Kindle functions with third party services, such as Wi-Fi access points, a third party may charge you fees for the use of those services. If your Kindle is not subject to a data plan or other third party fees, generally, we do not charge you for use of wireless connectivity.

However, your Kindle may use wireless connectivity to make other services available to you for which we may charge you a fee, such as personal file download and subscriptions when you are located in another country. The fees and terms for such services are located on the Amazon.com website or on or through your Kindle and may change from time to time.  
  
**Your Conduct.** You may use the wireless connectivity provided by us only in connection with the Service as permitted by this Agreement. You may not use the wireless connectivity for any other purpose.  
  
**Availability.** If your Kindle is located in an area in which it cannot maintain wireless connectivity, you may not be able to use some or all of the Service. We are not responsible for the unavailability of wireless connectivity for your Kindle or any corresponding loss of Service. Events beyond our reasonable control (such as changes in service or terms by wireless carriers) may impact the terms or circumstances under which we provide you wireless connectivity and may result in a change to these terms or a temporary or permanent modification or loss of wireless connectivity for your Kindle.

2\. Device and Software

**Use of the Software.** You may use the Software only on a Kindle or through a Reading Application on a Supported Device. Additional terms contained in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use apply to the Software. For additional terms that apply to certain third party software, see the Legal, Legal &. Compliance, or similar section in the Settings menu of your Kindle or the Legal Notices section of your Reading Application.  
  
**Location Based Services** **.** Some Kindle devices have a feature that, when enabled, allows Amazon and applications on your device to access location information that can be used to provide location based services. Learn more about collection and use of location data. If you are using location based services on your Kindle for navigation, you are solely responsible for ensuring you drive safely, observe all traffic rules, and use your own judgment while driving and selecting routes. Amazon does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or security of any location based services.
