The number of duplicate postings, especially low-quality posts have a negative and direct effect on the ease of finding quality listings. After conducting thorough investigation into this issue, including consulting with a wide range of buyers and sellers, we have made the following changes to the product posting rules on Alibaba.com:

**Definition of duplicate product posting:**

This refers to the practice by some sellers to display the same commodity as several different items for sale. The unique features of each commodity should be clearly understandable from the product title, description, pictures etc. – if not, it will be regarded as a duplicate posting.

**Identifying duplicate product postings (include but not limited to the following conditions):**

1\. In the case that the same seller sells the same products with same pictures, a highly similar title and attributes, it is regarded as a duplicate product post. All duplicate product postings will be treated a severe violation of the posting rules.

**Consequences of duplicate product postings**

If you are repeatedly found to be in violation of the posting rules by posting duplicate products, you will receive a number of warnings. If you fail to comply with the rules, your case will be escalated accordingly.

1\. Our system will run regular checks to identify repeat posts. When discovered, these posts will be removed leaving only the highest quality unique post live.

2\. Multiple duplicate post instances will cause your minisite shop ranking to be lowered. In serious cases, shops will be suspended or closed.  ;
