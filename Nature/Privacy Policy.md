Collecting browser activities or IP addresses, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited, are common practices, and are often performed automatically by many websites, applications and other services for such purposes as calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services. In addition:

*   We and our service providers collect information from the Apps that you use. We track and collect Apps’ usage data such as the date and time the Apps accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Apps based on your device number.

*   We collect information that can identify the physical location of your mobile device or geographic location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi signals to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.

*   We use “Cookies” and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to the Services or your responses to our e-mails or other electronic communications—both individually and in an aggregated form. Cookies are pieces of data placed on your device when you visit the Services that help us recognize you when you come back to the Website, allowing us, for example, to remember the email address and password you use when you log in on a specific computer. We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services.  We also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements.  At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track requests.  
      
    If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services and you may not be able to access some of the features we offer.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.  You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.

*   We use third-party web and mobile app analytics and optimization services to improve the Services and enhance the visitor experience by, for example, recording mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as text you type in the Services.

*   Aggregate information:  We share aggregate statistics and other non-personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes.  These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify you.

We use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  In some instances, we combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your location).  If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

*   Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them). or
