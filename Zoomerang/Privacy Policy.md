Our clients’ stories

“Working with the team was a great experience. Smooth, fast process. Deep analysis. New methodologies (blend of quantitative/qualitative). Things like this help our industry move forward.”

**– Marcello Formisano | Head of consumer planning and insights | Tata Global Beverages**

“Beyond their expertise in the topic, the key strength of MetrixLab lies in their flexibility and dedication to our project.

MetrixLab is not an agency of status-quo, you know there is always something brewing that might benefit you at some stage in terms of innovation.”

**– Francky David | Global HCP &. Consumer Insights | Nestlé**

"We wanted something simple, scalable, replicable, easy- to-implement and use.

Our collaboration with MetrixLab was smooth and constructive and the research exceeded our brief. We’ve now deployed it in other countries."

**– Laura Koenig | Head of Consumer and Business Insights | Orangina Suntory, France** 

“We shared the report with our Marketing head and the Brand team and had a very good discussion on the next steps.

We are moving forward to airing the copy with more confidence than before armed with the results.”

**– Annie Italia | Head of Marketing Strategy &. Insights | Essilor, AMERA**

"Based upon earlier experiences I was aware of the international competences of MetrixLab. This cooperation was one-country, more local level. I was really surprised with the willingness to help. In addition, MetrixLab contributed great insights and discussions. With a mutual goal: what's the most cost-efficient communication strategy for Westwing to really stand out".

**– Itai Gross | Managing Director | Westwing Home and Living, NL**
