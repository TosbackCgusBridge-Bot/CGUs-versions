When it comes to recruiting, time is a luxury and sometimes you just don’t have the time or resources to keep up with the hiring demands of your organization.

Source &. Screen leverages over 20 years of candidate behavior experience and the latest in labor market data to develop and execute an effective sourcing strategy for the positions you hire most frequently. Our experienced project managers will scour the CareerBuilder candidate marketplace of active and passive job seekers, and utilize leading job boards, resume databases and professional networking sites to find the right candidates for your business. Your dedicated specialist will then screen candidates either visually or through a phone call to eliminate those who may not be a fit, and deliver the entire book of top sourced talent for your review.

The candidates you receive from our Source &. Screen team are never shopped around to other companies: They’re yours to keep upon completion and you can hire as many of them as you like – all for one flat rate.
