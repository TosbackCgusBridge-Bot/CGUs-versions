**3\. Use and Sharing of Personal Information**

a) Spokeo may use Personal Information You provide to Spokeo.com to create and maintain Your account, to personalize Your experience, and to send periodic email communications relating to our services, such as purchase receipts, account confirmations, and customer care correspondence, including emails to customers who have abandoned the account setup experience and about searches You have previously performed. If You have made a purchase on Spokeo.com or accepted a trial of any of Spokeo’s premium subscriptions, You will be deemed to have opted-in to receive promotional emails from Spokeo, and Spokeo may use Your Personal Information to send You search tips, promotions, and information about new products we think may be of interest to You. Spokeo uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote the services offered on Spokeo.com. These third parties will access Your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, Spokeo provides payment data that You provide to certain payment processors, solely to effect the sale of products or subscriptions that You have requested, or may provide Your email address to third party services for purposes such as delivering email communications, providing customer support, and preventing fraudulent transactions, or may use a third-party service provider to facilitate upload of Your contacts from Your contact management providers, using the OAuth standard whenever possible (If Your contact management providers support the OAuth standard, use of the OAuth standard does not require Spokeo or its third-party service provider to have access to, and Spokeo and its third-party service provider, will not in fact have access to, the passwords that You established with Your contact management providers). Spokeo uses the Google Maps API(s), which is subject to the Google Privacy Policy.
