Additional InformationAggregation Services

To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.

*   The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
*   You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
*   Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.
*   We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.
*   If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
*   If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.
*   You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.

*   **Advertising on our Sites and Mobile Apps and off-line channels such as financial centers, call centers, and through direct marketing (for example email, mail, phone):** If you prefer we not provide you with tailored content and advertising based on your online behavior with our Sites and Mobile Apps, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. Please review the important **Reminder** section that follows.
*   **Advertising on Non-Affiliated Third Party sites:** Bank of America participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and uses the Advertising Options Icon on our behavioral ads on non-affiliated third party sites (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). Ads served on our behalf by these companies do not contain unencrypted personal information and we limit the use of personal information by companies that serve our ads. To learn more about ad choices, or to opt out of interest-based advertising with non-affiliated third party sites, visit YourAdChoices layer powered by the Digital Advertising Alliance or through the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool layer.

*   Financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use personal information collected online as described in this Notice to provide details on products and services in accordance with account agreements.
*   In order for online behavioral advertising opt outs from our Sites and Mobile Apps and on other sites to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies.
*   If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Sites and Mobile Apps or other sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.
*   If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.

Additional InformationAggregation Services

Some companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view it in one location or perform actions related to your accounts using their services (a "Provider"). To do this, a Provider may request you to authorize access to your Bank of America accounts by providing your Bank of America username and passcode or by providing your information-sharing consent directly to Bank of America.

*   The Provider may access, on your behalf, information about yourself, your Bank of America relationship, and your accounts at Bank of America.
*   You should use caution and ensure that the Provider has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any personal information you provide or to which they are gaining access.
*   Use of your information by the Provider is governed by your agreement with them, not by Bank of America.
*   We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site username and passcode.
*   If you share your Bank of America username, passcode or other information about your accounts with others, we will consider that you have authorized any transaction or action initiated by using the access information you provide.
*   If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to a Provider, we strongly recommend that you change your Bank of America passcode to ensure that the Provider cannot continue to access your account.
*   You may revoke your consent for certain Providers through the Security Center within Bank of America Online Banking.
