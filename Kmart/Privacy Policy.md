Some of these advertisements may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your computer's browsing activity, for example, anonymous information collected across multiple websites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving this type of targeted advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) opt-out page http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp .

Please note that if you delete your cookies, use another computer, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of relevant advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only those advertisements that are personalized to your interests.

**Other Web Sites**

We partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. Some of these advertisements are also personalized for you based on what we know about you. Please note that we do not share any information that identifies you personally with the third party service providers who serve ads on our behalf . If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising from us on other web sites, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out page www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members.

Is My Information Secure?

We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. Your information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive PII, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). Sensitive PII may include your drivers license, credit card number, social security number or protected health information, as may be applicable. While we do work very hard to protect your privacy, no method of security is 100% effective and we cannot be responsible for the actions of those who may gain unauthorized access to your personal information. Sears Holdings makes no warranties, express, implied or otherwise as to the ultimate effectiveness of these reasonable and appropriate safeguards.

Secure Password Guidelines

As an additive security measure, Sears recommends the following guidelines when establishing your online profile password:

Password should contain:

*   at least 8 characters
*   at least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
*   at least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
*   at least 1 numeric value (0-9)

It is also a sound practice to differentiate passwords across multiple online accounts. Using the same credentials for multiple online accounts creates the potential for security breaches.
