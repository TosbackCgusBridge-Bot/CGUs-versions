        We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect certain information about your use of the Platforms (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL, advertisements, or search terms that referred or otherwise led you to the Platforms (if applicable), aspects of the Platforms that you use or visit, the products or services you access or view, the types of e-cards you send, and the time of day you accessed the Platforms, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device”) used to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of a Device used to access the Platforms. Please note that your IP address is included in the header information of every e-card notification email that we send for your e-cards.
        
        The methods used to collect Usage Information may include:
        
        1.  Cookies
            
            We use a technology called "cookies" on the Platforms. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your Device for a variety of purposes that enable us to optimize the Platforms and your user experience. For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you re-enter the Platforms so that you will not have to sign-in each time you visit. In addition, we use cookies in connection with website analysis and advertising. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use the Platforms. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Platforms.
            
            A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings\_manager.html.

        2.  Web Beacons and Pixels
            
            We also use web beacons or 1x1 pixels to collect information on the Platforms and through emails we send. These pixels may be invisible to you and may be connected to your Personal Information, if you have provided it, to allow us to better serve you by tracking your interests on the Platforms. We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise distribute information about you gathered through the web beacons or pixels with any third parties, except for third parties who provide us with advertising, marketing, research or analysis services.

        3.  Embedded Scripts
            
            An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platforms, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Platforms, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
            
            Usage Information is very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We and our third-party service providers use this type of data to help us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our Platforms, which, in turn, enables us to make our Platforms as appealing as possible. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.

We may share the information regarding your transaction with third parties as necessary to process your transaction (i.e., to send the card).
            
            The Platforms may also allow you to import information about third parties through several methods, including directly from your computer or mobile device or from a third-party service (e.g., through Social Media Interactions or by asking you for your login information to your email or other account). If you choose to provide Personal Information about third parties or to import your contacts, we will store that information only in connection with your relationship with us (e.g., to send greeting cards). Unless you consent, we will not store the password you provide if you import your contacts from a third party source.
