Privacy Overview

Privacy is important to Blackboard and the teachers, learners and educational institutions that we serve. Blackboard is committed to following both legal obligations and best practices with regard to the collection, protection, use and storage of private information. We also support the privacy policies of your educational institution.

Privacy: Your Institution, Blackboard and You

Blackboard provides products run by your educational institution at a non-Blackboard site. Blackboard products also connect with managed service offerings that are run from within Blackboard datacenters located around the world. For products installed at non-Blackboard sites, Blackboard recommends that you consult with your educational institution's privacy policies. Blackboard provides a number of configuration options to allow your local institution to implement its privacy guidelines within our products.  
  
Use of managed service offerings may result in collection of private information by Blackboard. We work to protect the confidentiality of this information and will detail the types of information we collect on the pages linked below. By using Blackboard Managed Services you consent to the privacy policy linked below.

Support for SSL Encryption

Any institution may choose to run its Blackboard Learn solution under SSL. SSL is a browser technology that encrypts the data transmitted between your computer and the Blackboard server. SSL websites have an address that begins with https:// instead of http:// (note the additional s). Blackboard strongly encourages all schools to run under SSL to ensure data privacy of transmitted data and to secure the transmission of login and password information.

European Union and Switzerland Data Protection

Blackboard complies with the U.S.&—EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.—Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
