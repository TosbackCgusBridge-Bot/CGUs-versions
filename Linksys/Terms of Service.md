**_Important Notice Regarding Your Consumer Rights:_** SOME COUNTRIES, STATES AND/OR PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES AND/OR DO NOT ALLOW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO BE SOLD WITH NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES. ACCORDINGLY, IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE SECTIONS ON "NO WARRANTIES" AND "GENERAL EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY" MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. ONLY THOSE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS THAT ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND, IN SUCH INSTANCES, BELKIN'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE LIMITED WARRANTIES MAY VARY BASED ON THE LOCAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, BELKIN'S SERVICES COMES WITH STATUTORY GUARANTEES, INCLUDING AS TO QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR PURPOSE WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW OR THE CONSUMER GUARANTEES ACT 1993 (NEW ZEALAND) (AS FURTHER EXPLAINED BELOW).

These Terms of Use are not intended to and do not:

*   change or exclude any statutory consumer rights that cannot be lawfully changed or excluded. or
*   limit or exclude any right you have against the person who sold a Belkin Product to you if that person has breached their sales contract with you.

**_If you are located in Australia or New Zealand, the following two paragraphs apply to you:_**

Certain legislation, including the Australian Consumer Law and the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 (New Zealand) may imply warranties or conditions, or impose guarantees or obligations on Belkin, which operate to protect certain Australian or New Zealand purchasers of goods and services in various circumstances ("AU Applicable Laws" or "NZ Applicable Laws" as the case may be).  Nothing in these Terms of Use excludes, restricts or modifies any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy implied or imposed by any AU Applicable Laws which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified.  If any condition, warranty or guarantee is implied into these Terms of Use or imposed on Belkin under AU Applicable Laws and cannot be excluded, but Belkin is permitted by an AU Applicable Law to limit Belkin’s remedy for a breach of such a condition, warranty or guarantee, then the liability of Belkin for breach of the condition, warranty or guarantee is limited to one or more of the following, at Belkin’s option: (a) in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired. or (b) in the case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again. 

If any condition, warranty or guarantee is implied into these Terms of Use or imposed on Belkin under NZ Applicable Laws and cannot be excluded, but Belkin has a choice of a remedy, then the liability of Belkin for breach of the condition, warranty or guarantee is limited to one or more of the following, at Belkin’s option: (a) in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of goods of identical type, the repair of the goods, or the refund of the goods if it would be unreasonable to expect the products to be repaired. or (b) in the case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.  In addition to these remedies a "consumer" (within the meaning of the Consumer Guarantees Act) may claim for any reasonably foreseeable loss (other than loss or damage through reduction of value of the goods) that results from the initial problem.

Subject to the section regarding Consumer Rights above, you agree that:

1.  Use of the Site and the Services is at your sole risk.
2.  IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DATA THAT YOU MAY USE OR POSSESS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE OR SERVICE.  ANY MATERIAL, INFORMATION OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR A SERVICE IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR YOUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND PERIPHERALS OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULT FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL, INFORMATION OR DATA;
3.  Belkin and its suppliers, licensors, resellers, retailers and affiliates do not guarantee that your use of the Site and the Services will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in a particular jurisdiction, the Site and the Services are provided “AS IS” and "AS AVAILABLE" for your use without warranties, guarantees, conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise.
4.  No advice or information (whether oral or written) obtained by you from Belkin on or via the Site or Services will create any warranty or condition not expressly stated in these Terms of Use;
5.  The warranties and remedies set out in these Terms of Use are exclusive, and, to the extent permitted by law, in lieu of all others oral or written, express, or implied.

We do not guarantee any continued availability of a third party’s service for which the Site’s or a Service’s use or operation may require. 

In addition, please note that some Services may monitor energy consumption in the home. Belkin does not guarantee or promise any specific level of energy savings or other monetary benefit from the use of the Services or any other feature. Actual energy savings and any associated monetary benefits vary based on factors beyond Belkin’s control or knowledge. From time to time, Belkin may use the Service to provide you with information that is unique to you and your energy usage and suggests an opportunity to save money on energy bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Service. You agree that this information is not a guarantee of actual savings, and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from Belkin if your savings differs. All information provided to you by Belkin is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date.

General Exclusions and Limitations of Liability  

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BELKIN, ITS AFFILIATES, ASSOCIATES, DEALERS, AGENTS OR SUPPLIERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS AND ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR:

1.  ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO YOUR HOME, HVAC SYSTEM, ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, PLUMBING, YOUR PRODUCT AND PERIPHERALS (WHETHER OR NOT CONNECTED TO A BELKIN PRODUCT), COMPUTER, MOBILE DEVICE, AND ALL OTHER ITEMS AND PETS IN YOUR HOME. AND
2.

AND FOR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS WHATSOEVER,

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF BELKIN, ITS AFFILIATES, ASSOCIATES, DEALERS, AGENTS OR SUPPLIERS TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00). THIS LIMITATION IS CUMULATIVE AND WILL NOT BE INCREASED BY THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE INCIDENT OR CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY WARRANTY OR REMEDY PROVIDED FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF BELKIN IN RELATION TO DEATH OR BODILY INJURIES.

IF YOU LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, REFERENCES TO "SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES" SHALL MEAN ANY LOSSES WHICH (I) WERE NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE BY BOTH PARTIES. (II) WERE KNOWN TO YOU BUT NOT TO US.

Belkin will be irreparably harmed if you violate any of these Terms of Use, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you agree that Belkin may obtain such injunctive or equitable relief that Belkin deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Belkin may have at law or in equity.

If Belkin is the subject of a claim, becomes involved in a legal proceeding, or suffers any loss or damage because of your violation of these Terms of Use, to the extent permitted by law, you will be responsible for compensating Belkin for the full amount of its loss, as well as any reasonable amounts Belkin incurs in lawyers' fees, expenses and court costs, except to the extent that Belkin contributed to the loss or damage, in addition to any other relief granted to Belkin.
