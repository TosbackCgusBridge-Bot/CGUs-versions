AT&T Consumer Marketing

AT&T will maintain a company-specific (Internal) Do Not Mail (DNM) list of existing and prospective residential customers who request not to receive any AT&T marketing materials via US Postal Mail.

*   Consumers must contact the AT&T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list.
*   Generally AT&T processes DNM requests within 30 days. However, because our mailings are processed well in advance, you may continue to receive additional offers for some time after the request date.'
    *   Please note that AT&T may direct mail market to certain neighborhoods or zip codes. These offerings are delivered to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code. You may continue to receive this type of mailing even if you opt-out of receiving marketing related postal mailings from AT&T.
*   DNM requests for an individual consumer at a residential address will remain in effect for THREE years from the date of request.
*   AT&T does not accept DNM requests from third party providers.
*   AT&T DNM requests will expire upon change of address.

AT&T will not share or disclose DNM information with any third party other than AT&T vendors responsible for direct mail marketing on AT&T's behalf.

Notifications and other non-solicitation mail pieces are exempt from this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM Policy.

AT&T reserves the right to discontinue this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy, and may cease accepting DNM requests or otherwise modify this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy.
