× Frequently Asked Questions Why Am I Here? The ATT Web Helper has been enabled to provide helpful searches from web address errors.

Often, you will see a desired website or page that meets your needs. Do you track my Internet usage? No. The ATT Web Helper simply redirects queries to non-existing domain names to a useful search results page instead of a cryptic error message page or browser-defined page. What is DNS?
