Advertisement Class of 2018: The New and Redesigned Cars, Trucks and SUVs by KBB.com Editors | January 25, 2018 4:39 PM 2018 Honda Accord

The 2018 model year is well under way, and most of this year's new and redesigned vehicles have made their way to dealer lots near you. There’s something new for everyone as automakers have revamped best-selling mainstream models like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, while offering up some tasty all-new entries like the Kia Stinger sport sedan and Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV.

But even as automakers start unveiling the all-new cars, trucks and SUVs heading our way for 2019, surprises keep coming for 2018. At the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show, for instance, the world premieres included a mix of both.
