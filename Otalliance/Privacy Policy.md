Wed, Dec 7, 2016 Fall Technology Series: Smart TV

Consumers enjoy recommendations based on their television viewing habits (“viewers who watched Mr. Robot… may enjoy Fight Club”), but who else knows what you’re watching? The golden age of television has arrived with the golden age of television tracking. In 2016, virtually all television delivery systems – smart TVs, streaming devices, game consoles, apps, and even old-fashioned set top boxes – track consumers’ viewing habits, and sometimes in new and unexpected ways.

Mon, Nov 7, 2016 Don’t Be a Tool – Verifying Subscriptions and Honoring Unsubscribes

This summer the email marketing industry suffered a setback due to “list bomb” attacks in which thousands of targeted users were unknowingly subscribed to tens of thousands of mailings.
