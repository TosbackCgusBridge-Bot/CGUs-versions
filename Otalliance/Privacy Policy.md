Thu, Jan 28, 2016 Security Best Practice to Drive Trust in IoT

In recogntion of World Data Protection Day, please join OTA and Cryptosoft reviewing the challenges and opportunities of IoT devices. With over 20bn connected devices expected globally by 2020 (Gartner) the opportunities are huge – however this also comes with security risks. With data passing through these 6bn devices how will we ensure security without halting technical advances?  IoT also has the fundamental problem of ownership. IoT ecosystems invariably consist of a mix of ownership, standards and technologies.

Thu, Jan 28, 2016 Security Best Practices to Drive Trust in IoT

In response to the increasing levels of data breaches and the global importance of privacy and data security, in 2010 the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) and dozens of global organizations embraced Data Protection Day as Data Privacy &.

Tue, Dec 15, 2015 Top Ten Practices: Correct Collection Leads to Improved Connection

For the past several years, marketers have been capturing email addresses at brick-and-mortar locations. As we approach another holiday buying season there will likely be a bump in this practice. The immediate value driver for the consumer is typically an electronic receipt, which is certainly a convenience, but the practice also helps brands to connect with customers. There are tradeoffs, however.

Wed, Dec 9, 2015 It Sees You When You're Sleeping, It Knows When You're Awake

I love my fitness tracker.  Not only does it affirm me (I met my today’s goal!), it also supports my inner narrative (of course I’m cranky – I slept badly last night… be nice to me).  Last holiday season it was the gift I didn’t even know I wanted until I got it.  This year, we’re both older and wiser. Trust in our relationship has shifted from blind innocence to practical, mature action.  I’ve come to realize more and more about how my device gathers, transmits and stores reams of personal data on me and my habits.

Thu, Nov 12, 2015 Why We Need an IoT Framework

We already suspected our smart TVs were ‘watching’ our viewing behavior and sharing data with advertising and television business partners.  Now, our smart TVs can open our homes to criminals. 

Wed, Oct 28, 2015 Moving to a World of Trusted IoT Devices &. Services

Today represents a significant milestone, the release of the “last call” of the IoT Trust Framework.  For the past 8 months the IoT Trustworthy working group has been meeting, debating and sharing insights into criteria which today has formed the IoT Trust framework.  Over the next three weeks we will be soliciting input and reviewing feedback to integrate into what promises to be the foundation for an IoT trustworthy code of conduct and future certification programs.
