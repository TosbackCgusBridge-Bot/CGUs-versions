Thu, Oct 30, 2014 Always On: The Digital Consumer

Welcome to the age of the Internet of Things. Devices in our homes are connected to the Internet, our cars are starting to talk to each other wirelessly, and we are attaching mobile-enabled devices to our wrists to measure fitness. Awesome or scary? Most likely, a bit of both.

Tue, Nov 4, 2014 Privacy &. Big Data Overload

Due to the evolution of personalized, data-driven digital marketing, companies now have infinite amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) about their customers—and it just keeps exponentially growing. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, the volume of business data worldwide—across all companies—doubles every 1.2 years.
