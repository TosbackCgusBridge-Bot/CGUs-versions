Sun, Nov 2, 2014 Cybersecurity, The Blind Side, The Insider Threat

**Cybersecurity, The Blind Side, The Insider Threat**

Perhaps you remember the football movie, The Blind Side, with Sandra Bullock about an impoverished young boy who was adopted and eventually became a NFL football player. The blind side is also a football term which loosely means “something that approaches from the side you cannot see.” Usually the side of the quarterback away from where he is looking. Do we have a “blind side” in cybersecurity too? Perhaps.

With the rapid surge in data breaches impacting millions of households this year, OTA was optimistic on the possible passage of data breach legislation.  Unfortunately it is appearing very unlikely we will see any such legislation, driven in part by the partisan efforts and trade groups who are focused on protecting their business member's short-term interests and consumer advocates who appear to be unwilling to compromise.  OTA continues to be a voice of reason advocating a framework modeled off of CAN-SPAM and COPPA, providing businesses with clarity and ease of report

Wed, Oct 15, 2014 Sen Franken Calls DOJ to Shut Down Stalking Apps Sen. Al Franken is pushing the Justice Department to do more to protect smartphone users from "stalking apps" that surreptitiously track their targets. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, Franken noted the department's work on the issue - including the recent indictment of a man who operated one spyware app, StealthGenie - but said it needs to go further. OTA supports this effort. Share your views and interest in signing on in support of this effort. Read more >. Resources
