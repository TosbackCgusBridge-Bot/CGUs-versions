Thu, Jan 18, 2018 Why Is Everyone Talking about Email Authentication and Why Should I Care?

Traditional content filtering approaches for email security will not stop the Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack vector because there is no malware nor attachment to pattern-match when a criminal sends a fake email impersonating your CFO, other executives, or partners and colleagues you are expected to trust.  In this webinar, we will look at an important new layer to email security - the authentication of senders.
