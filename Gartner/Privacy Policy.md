*   profile photograph

Information Collected Automatically

When you use our websites or apps, we automatically collect and analyze certain information, which includes unique browser identifiers, IP addresses, browser and operating system information, device identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID), geolocation and other device-specific information, Internet connection information, as well as details about your interactions with websites and apps.

When you access Gartner content via our apps, the apps will store an authentication token so you will not need to login every time.

Use of Cookies and Other Technologies

We and third parties use various technologies to collect information about your activities on the Gartner websites and apps.

*   Cookies and other local storage technologies. Cookies and local storage objects are files that contain data, such as unique identifiers, that we or a third party transfer to or read from your device to recognize the device, provide services, keep records, and conduct analytics and marketing. We and third parties use automated means to read or write information on your devices. These means include various types of cookies and other browser-based or plugin-based local storage (such as HTML5 storage or Flash-based storage). 

You may choose to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.  Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage and Flash storage.  However, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies or local storage, certain websites (including our own Websites) may not function properly.

*   Other technologies. We use other standard automated technologies, such as web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) or similar technologies to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our websites and/or apps. We include web beacons in email messages to track whether you open the messages, as well as for other uses as described below.

In some cases, we facilitate the collection of information by advertising services administered by third parties. The ad services track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means such as cookies, and they use this information to show you ads tailored to your individual interests or characteristics and/or based on prior visits to certain sites or apps, or other information we know, infer or have collected from you. 

*   For example, we and the third-party vendors use first- and third-party cookies together, as well as other automated means and other data (such as the data described above) to:
    *   Recognize you and your devices;
    *   Inform, optimize, and serve ads. and
    *   Report on our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services (including how they are related to visits to specific sites or apps). 

To learn more about interest-based advertising generally, including how to opt out from the targeting of interest-based ads by some of our current ad service partners, click here.  For controls specific to advertising and analytics services offered by Google, click here, here and here.  If you replace, change or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again.  We do not respond to browser-based do-not-track signals.

Please refer to your mobile device manufacturer's website (or the website for its operating system) for instructions on how to use any additional privacy controls offered by your mobile operating system, such as privacy settings for device identifiers and geolocation.

We use and disclose your information as follows:

*   On the basis of implied or express consent, such as:

    *   To customize the content and advertising you see on our websites and apps, across the Internet, and elsewhere;
    *   At events:
        *   You may choose to use a badge with an RFID chip, which has a unique identifier that can be scanned from various distances. If you select an RFID-enabled badge, we may use it to track your location around our event sites so we can better understand your areas of interest.
        *   If you do not want us to track your location, you may obtain a non-RFID enabled badge by asking Events staff at the registration desk.
        *   You may choose to share your contact details with our event sponsors by allowing them to scan your event badge. Our sponsors’ use of any information you choose to share with them in this way is governed by each sponsor’s Privacy Policy.

    *   To fulfill your requests;
    *   To respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;
    *   To otherwise communicate with you about your account;
    *   To carry out certain marketing activities;
    *   To conduct research and analysis, including surveys;
    *   For events:

Some features of our websites, apps and services allow you to make data public or engage in other sharing.  For example:

*   If you post content or otherwise participate in discussion forums or other social areas of our websites or apps, your participation (including the content you post, your name, and a link to your profile) may be shared across our websites and apps and in other public or private areas of the internet.
