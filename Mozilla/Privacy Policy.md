This privacy notice applies to Mozilla operated websites and mobile apps, which include the domains mozillians.org, mozilla.org, firefox.com, and webmaker.org, among others. This includes, for example, bugzilla.mozilla.org, reps.mozilla.org, careers.mozilla.org, developers.mozilla.org, support.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org, and wiki.mozilla.org.

*   **Social Media**: If you engage with our social media accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook, we may receive personal information about you. If you use these networks, their privacy policies apply, and you are encouraged to read them.
    
*   **Job, Intern &. Fellow Applicants**: Applicants for employment, internship or fellowship opportunities with Mozilla are required to give us a name, street address, telephone number, email address, and resume. We use this information to process and evaluate applications and to communicate with applicants about opportunities. We use a third party vendor to assist us with employment applications. For more information on our data practices with third party vendors, see our Mozilla Privacy Policy.
    
*   **Contributors**: Volunteering for Mozilla as a community contributor may require Mozilla and others to communicate with you at the email address that you provide in connection to your contribution and to recognize your efforts. If you contribute to Bugzilla, Mozilla Reps, or our code base, then your email address and possibly your name will be publicly available to all internet users. If you create a profile at Mozillians.org, it will be accessible to Mozilla employees and Mozilla contributors. You can edit your profile data at Profile Settings. We sometimes use contributor information from sources (such as Bugzilla) in dashboards to visually share aggregated data on the Mozilla community. An example is https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Dashboards. If possible, we try to minimize contact information that is publicly displayed.
    
*   **User Feedback**: You can provide feedback to us on our products and services on webpages like input.mozilla.org, through an in-product experience, or through channels such as email, Bugzilla, IRC, a social media account, our Get Involved page, or through a group like Student Ambassadors. Please minimize the personal information you choose to share on these forums because your comments may be accessible to the public.
    
*   **Accounts**: Some websites, for example Marketplace, AMO, MDN, and Webmaker, require account creation to submit developer content. submit user reviews or comments. or install certain types of apps. You may periodically receive emails in connection with your account.

For example, you can request a link by email or SMS to install Firefox on your mobile device or petition your legislators on internet issues.

    *   Optimizely and ShareProgress, which place a cookie on your device, to help us test variations of web content. This helps us offer better web experiences to users.
    *   DoubleClick and Flashtalking, each of which uses a clear GIF on our download Firefox page. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.

    *   HTTP Referral Data, which may be included with Firefox’s installer, to understand the website domain or advertising campaign that referred you to our download page. This information helps us understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and improve them.
    *   Other metrics tools from time to time, on an experimental basis. For example, we may do this to help evaluate a new metrics tool, or test existing metrics collection.

You can control individual cookie preferences, indicate your cookie preferences to others, and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools. Learn More

*   **Cookie History**: You can accept or decline individual cookies in your Firefox preferences in the Tools/Options/Privacy history section. Note that certain features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
    
*   **Do Not Track**: Mozilla does not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising. If you have configured your browser to send a “Do Not Track” signal when accessing our websites, Mozilla will not utilize any of the tools described in the Metrics section.
