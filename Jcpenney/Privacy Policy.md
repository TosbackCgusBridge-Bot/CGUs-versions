**the information we collect**

  Whenever you shop in our stores, at jcp.com, or through our mobile applications, we obtain from you the information we need to complete your transaction. This information may include your name, address, telephone number, driver's license number, birth date, and email address.  If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, it will include your account number.  

If you register with jcp.com or sign up to receive mobile or email updates from JCPenney, we will collect the information you submit.

If you choose to use or participate in one of our various services, promotions, programs, surveys, sweepstakes or clubs, we may collect additional information about you.

From your transactions and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use.

We may also obtain information about other people from you. For example, if you order a gift to be delivered directly to a friend, you would need to give us the friend’s name and address.

We receive information from other companies. For example, if you have a JCPenney credit card, we receive application and account information from GE Capital Retail Bank (GECRB), the company that owns and administers JCPenney credit accounts (see the "your JCPenney credit account" section of this policy for additional information).  
We also collect consumer information from third-party providers in order to improve the accuracy of our customer database or increase our understanding of our customers. For example, we get updated addresses from the National Change of Address (NCOA) service, licensed by the U.S. Postal Service, to assist us in having the correct addresses for our customers.  
  We work with certain websites to present advertising to known groups of our customers when they visit those websites. This practice, referred to as "data matching" is facilitated by a third-party service provider for JCPenney and the advertising website. This practice avoids direct sharing of any personal data with the advertising website. Data received back through this process is used to analyze the effectiveness of such advertising to groups of customers.  
     **using the information we collect**  
We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

*   completing your purchase transactions
*   providing the services you request
*   contacting you about the status of your store or jcp.com orders
*   responding to your customer service inquiries or requests
*   notifying you of product recalls or providing other information concerning products you have purchased
*   helping to protect against fraudulent use of your personal information
*   sending you direct mail offerings
*   sending you email communications
*   administering customer recognition programs, sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions
*   identifying your product and service preferences, so that you can be informed of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you
*   providing mobile marketing and service messages when requested
*   inviting you to participate in surveys
*   improving merchandise selections, customer service, and the overall customer shopping experience

**information we share with others**

*   **JCPenney family:**  We share information we collect with affiliated companies and licensees (like the optical and photography departments in JCPenney retail stores) within the JCPenney family of businesses.
 *   **service providers:**  We provide information to other companies that provide support services that help us bring you the products and services we offer, market our products and services, or process your transactions. For instance we share information with our international fulfillment service provider, Borderfree, for the purpose of facilitating the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally. We also provide information to GECRB and other service providers in connection with the JCPenney credit programs.
.*   **third-party offers:** We provide information to responsible outside companies. These carefully selected companies may use the information we share to let you know about their products or services, which may include providing special offers to you.
  *   **promotion sponsors: ** If you enter a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion sponsored or co-sponsored by a third-party company, we may forward information about you to that company. 
 *   **others:**  On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose the information we collect pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We may also disclose that information when we believe disclosure is appropriate to protect the rights, interests and property of JCPenney or others, and to protect the safety of customers, associates or others. This may include sharing information with other companies, attorneys, credit bureaus, agents or governmental agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection. Also, if the ownership of all or part of a business within the JCPenney family were to change, information about customers pertinent to that business’s operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner. The applicable member of the JCPenney family might also retain a copy of that information.

**safeguarding the information we collect**  

Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, protecting your personal information is important to us.  We have appropriate physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place to secure the personal information we collect from you.

We limit the information we provide to outside companies to only information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts or to offer you their products and services.  We contractually require that they have appropriate information security safeguards, and that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose.

**notice to California residents - your California privacy rights**

Under California law, a California resident with whom JCPenney has an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information JCPenney has shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to:  J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc., P.O. Box 10001, Dallas, TX 75301.  Attention: Corporate Customer Relations.

This same California law permits JCPenney to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information. You may exercise that choice by any of the means described under “sharing with other companies”.

**additional information about jcp.com and our mobile applications**

**online security**

Secure Socket Layering (SSL) technology is used to encrypt your credit or debit card information, including the account number, while it is transmitted over the Internet from your computer.  SSL is an industry standard technology for secure online transactions.

**unauthorized charges**

If unauthorized charges (as determined by your card issuer) are made on your credit or debit card as a result of purchases made on jcp.com utilizing our secure servers, JCPenney will reimburse you for up to $50 of any amounts you are required to pay by the card issuer. Also, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card provider cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges on a credit card. Your liability for unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher, but many debit card issuers voluntarily apply the $50 limit to their cards as well.

  
Remember:  In the event of unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you must promptly notify the card issuer pursuant to its reporting rules and procedures.  
 

**our use of cookies and other technologies**

****cookies -**** We and our service providers use "cookies" to collect and analyze information about your browsing and buying activity on our site (whether through the Internet or mobile applications).  Cookies also allow us and our service providers to understand how you clicked to our site and what pages you click on during your visit to our site, as well as how you use our mobile applications. Knowing how you prefer to shop allows us to improve your shopping experience and speed your checkout process.

A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer or device. When you arrive at jcp.com, cookies allow us to recognize you by an identification number in the cookie associated with the information that you as a customer have provided us. If you register with us at jcp.com, your e-mail address is saved in your cookie. We do not store your name (unless it is part of your email address), street address or credit card number in your cookie.  

Accepting cookies through your web browser is your personal choice. If you use the privacy settings on your web browser to disable cookies, you can still browse jcp.com, but you may not have as exceptional a shopping experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs. However, if you block cookies you will not be able to make a purchase on jcp.com.

**web beacons -** A “web beacon” (also called a pixel tag or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on web site pages and in emails and other marketing communications that allows us and our service providers to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access those pages or open email messages and other marketing communications, the web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  That information is used to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site or mobile applications, and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail advertising and  other marketing communications. Our contracts with our service providers require them to limit their use of such information to the purposes authorized by us.  

**flash cookies –** A Flash cookie (also known as a Local Shared Object) is a data file stored on your computer by the websites you visit using Adobe Flash technology, and is persistent. We or our service providers may use Flash cookies to enable or control Flash-based content and for other uses similar to those provided by the cookies discussed earlier in this section. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies.  You can manage the use of Flash cookies via the Settings Manager on Adobe’s website at http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.  You may also be able to manage them through your browser, depending on the version of the browser.

These companies collect and analyze information about how people use our site, including information about browsing and buying activities on jcp.com. To perform some of these services, they may collect and use information from first- and third-party cookies. In addition, Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics also provide services that analyze information regarding visits to certain portions of jcp.com that are operated for JCPenney by third parties, such as our Bali and Levolor blinds and shades pages, and personalized jewelry pages.

**technology used to serve advertising** – We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads (e.g. banners or links) tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop on jcp.com and other sites over time, and to perform tracking and reporting functions with respect to our ads. We also allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our site and to use that information to serve ads for JCPenney products or services, or the products or services of other companies when you visit our site or other sites. For instance, we and third-party vendors, such as Google, use first- and third-party cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to inform, optimize and serve ads based upon a user’s past visits to our website and to report upon how our ad impressions and other ad services are related to jcp.com.  We may combine and associate the information we collect through these technologies with other information we have collected from and about you. This collective information may be used, among other things, for interest-based advertising (also called “online behavioral advertising”) in order to personalize your online experience, improve our website, evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising, and to tailor our marketing to you.

At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt-out of interest-based advertising, as well as the other choices described in the “your choices regarding the use of information we collect” section of this policy. 

To learn more about interest-based advertising and how to “opt-out” of interest based advertising programs from participating companies, please go to the Network Advertising Initiative website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp or the Digital Advertising Alliance website at http://www.aboutads.info/. Please note that the opt-outs you make on one or both of those websites only apply to the receipt of interest-based advertising from participating companies.  You may still receive other types of online advertising from participating companies, and the websites you visit may still collect information for other purposes. Also, your opt-out status will be maintained by placement of an “opt-out” cookie on your computer.  If the cookie is removed or deleted, or you upgrade to a new version of your browser, change browsers or visit us from a different computer or device, you will need to repeat this process to indicate your opt-out preference

**aggregate information**

We collect non-personal information about how users navigate through our web site. We aggregate this information in order to improve our site, and we may share this information with our affiliates or other outside companies. This aggregated information does not include individual names or personal data, so it does not identify you or any other customer.

**children's privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 on our web site.

**links to other sites**

While visiting jcp.com, you may link to other web sites.  Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy.  When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the site operator’s privacy policy, not the JCPenney privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information. 

**international customer privacy**

JCPenney has contracted with Borderfree, Inc. (“Borderfree”) to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally (an “international order”).

When you place an international order, you will submit personal information (e.g. your name, email address, billing address, and shipping address) and other order-related information to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  If you also choose to create a jcp.com account, any personal information you provide will also be transferred to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  Please note that United States law may not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the laws in your home country.  This privacy policy applies to any personal information you furnish JCPenney in connection with international orders, your jcp.com account or otherwise.

JCPenney will then share your international order information, including personal information about you, with Borderfree for the purpose of facilitating ordering and shipping internationally.  Borderfree  will process personal information about you in accordance with its privacy policy .  Borderfree has agreed not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international orders and shipments.

By placing an international order, you acknowledge and agree that jcp will transfer personal information about you to Borderfree, and acknowledge that your financial transaction and shipment will be processed by Borderfree.  During the checkout process, you will be presented with Borderfree’s terms and conditions and privacy policy.  You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.

Once your order is approved, JCPenney will ship it to Borderfree.  Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product(s) you ordered from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities and arrange for the product(s) to be delivered to you.  In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. 

Customers shipping internationally who wish to:

*   Inquire about or update their personal information,
*   Make a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information, or
*   Comment on or ask questions regarding this privacy policy,

should email us at privacy@jcpenneyeservices.com

   We may change our privacy policy from time to time.  When considering any change, your privacy will remain a priority. If we change our privacy policy in the future, we will let you know by posting the updated policy at this website. We encourage you to check our policy periodically.
