**children's privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 through our websites or mobile applications

**links to other sites and social media widgets**

You may link to other sites from our websites.  Those sites have their own policies regarding privacy.  When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the site operator’s privacy policy, not the JCPenney privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information. 

Our websites and our mobile applications include social media features, for example the Facebook Like button, and Facebook, Google Plus, Interest, and Twitter widgets. Social media features or widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.

**international customer privacy**

JCPenney has contracted with Borderfree, Inc. (“Borderfree”) to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally (an “international order”).

When you place an international order, you will submit personal information (e.g. your name, email address, billing address, and shipping address) and other order-related information to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  If you also choose to create a jcpenney.com account, any personal information you provide will also be transferred to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  Please note that United States law may not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the laws in your home country.  This privacy policy applies to any personal information you furnish JCPenney in connection with international orders, your jcpenney.com account or otherwise.

JCPenney will then share your international order information, including personal information about you, with Borderfree for the purpose of facilitating ordering and shipping internationally.  Borderfree will process personal information about you in accordance with its privacy policy.  Borderfree has agreed not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international orders and shipments.

By placing an international order, you acknowledge and agree that jcp will transfer personal information about you to Borderfree, and acknowledge that your financial transaction and shipment will be processed by Borderfree.  During the checkout process, you will be presented with Borderfree’s terms and conditions and privacy policy.  You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.

Once your order is approved, JCPenney will ship it to Borderfree.  Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product(s) you ordered from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities and arrange for the product(s) to be delivered to you.  In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. 

Customers shipping internationally should email us at privacy@jcpenneyeservices.com if they wish to:

*   Inquire about or update their personal information,
*   Make a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information, or
*   Comment on or ask questions regarding this privacy policy,

should email us at privacy@jcpenneyeservices.com
