Information Collection

User's may choose to become a registered user, in which case they may choose to reveal information about themselves, such as their email address and other information that they enter while using the website. This site does not secretly collect any personally identifiable information. The information that we collect will never be shared or sold beyond what is described below.

Information Use

Your email address is used as a way for you to sign into the website. It is also used to communicate important information about your account. Profile information that you choose to give us (such as a profile picture or name) is used to personalize the website and provide a nicer experience.

Through using the website, you may also choose to enter information such as tasks you want to do, notes you want to remember, habits you want to make, etc. Toodledo uses this information for the sole purpose of displaying it back to you when you request it. Toodledo does not read or analyze the contents of what you have entered in this way.

If you choose to become a subscriber, we will need to collect some billing information from you. We send this information to our payment processor (Stripe or PayPal depending on your choice at checkout) so that we can bill you and provide you with the enhanced features that come with a subscription. Toodledo does not store billing information on our servers after passing it off to our payment processor.

Your Rights to Your Data

Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's hard drive. This site uses cookies to keep you signed in and to maintain state between pages. The user may remove these cookies at any time by logging out of the web site.

A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Declining cookies will prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

We also use cookies related to our affiliate scheme which are used to track how you first arrived on this website and, if appropriate, to award our affiliates.

Log Files

We use IP addresses and browser type to analyze trends and administer the site. We do not do reverse DNS lookups, so IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses stored in log files are automatically deleted after 90 days.

Analytics

Toodledo uses Google Analytics to monitor the website and make improvements. Google collections information such as your IP number and browser. Google also infers information such as gender and age and aggregates this information in a way that enables us to improve our service. You may opt-out of Google's tracking here and here. Toodledo does not facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected by Google.

If you agree to become a beta tester, we may use additional 3rd party analytics software to collection additional information that we may need to improve our service.

Toodledo does not rent or sell your information, but we do disclose your information to a limited set of third parties in the situations explained below, for which you, by using our services, hereby explicitly consent.

*   There are many third-party applications that can sync with Toodledo. If you choose to link your account with a third-party application, all of your information can be downloaded, read, modified and deleted by this third-party application as if it was you.

Toodledo also works with third party providers which provide important functions to us that allow us to provide you a better service. We need to disclose user data to them from time to time so that the services can be performed. We only share information with the third party that is required for the service they are offering and contractually bind these providers to keep any information we share with them as confidential and to be used only for particular purposes. For example, amongst others, we have providers that process our credit card transactions (Stripe, Paypal), market our products (Google, Facebook), and manage our marketing communications (CampaignMonitor).
