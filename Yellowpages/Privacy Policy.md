Chief Privacy Officer

 A computer, email, and phone icon take turns appearing and connecting to a green check mark. Data helps us create better, more reliable products, services and experiences.

Data helps us mobilize your world by creating dependable services and experiences. For example, data helps us with the planning and optimization of our smart network. It also helps us prevent bad customer experiences like dropped calls.

 A floating shield featuring a lock emblem moves up and down on screen and pulses outward. Data helps improve security and prevent fraud.

Data helps us and our third-party service partners strengthen network and device security and detect fraud, identity theft, and other ways that the bad guys try to hurt you and us.

 A series of data lines grow from the outside of a heart icon while a city animates inside of it. Data helps improve programs for social good.

By using our resources, we make the world a better place. For example, data has helped us raise awareness of the risks of texting while driving. And data can help us make cities smarter by reducing traffic, pollution, and much more.

 A spinning wheel slows down and lands on a section which grows from the center, revealing a media icon. Data helps us customize offers for our products and services that may interest you.

Your information helps us not only power your products and services, it helps us communicate service updates and offers. Data allows us to offer you our best products and services.

×Updates to the AT&T Privacy Policy  

We made some updates and clarifications to our Policy effective February 15, 2019. Here is a summary:

*   We've added Xandr to our list of examples of the various AT&T companies. That's the name of the advertising company we formed last year.
*   We've clarified that the policy's definition of Anonymous Information includes advertising IDs when they can't be used to identify you.
*   We note that advertising IDs are used and shared to deliver ads to you and help advertisers assess the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. You have the choice to opt in to some advertising programs, or say no to others. You can make your choices at att.com/cmpchoice.

We’ve done our best to give you the high-level points in an easy-to-understand format on this site, but we understand that sometimes you want the full policy.
