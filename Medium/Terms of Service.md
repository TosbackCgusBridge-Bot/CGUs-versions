We’ll try to make this as painless as possible.

This is a contract between you and The Obvious Corporation, applicable when you use the Medium site, services, and products.

Even if your eyes normally glaze over at the word “Terms”, it’s a good idea to read these Terms carefully before you use Medium. For one thing, we want your feedback and suggestions on how to make them better. (For real: Email your input to terms@medium.com.) For another, we’ve worked to make them as easy-to-understand as possible.

**These Terms Are a Binding Agreement**

By using Medium Services, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn’t use Medium Services – in fact, unless you agree, we can’t even permit you to use them. Yes, we’re that hardcore about our precious Terms.

**We May Modify the Terms and Agreement**

We have the right to change this Agreement at any time by posting a revised Agreement. Changes may become effective as soon as they are posted. If we in our sole discretion determine that the changes are material, we will notify you via the Medium site or email to the email address we have on file. Your use of Medium Services after the posting of a revised Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the revised Agreement.

If you are outside the United States, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information, including but not limited to User Content and any other personal information, to and in the United States and/or other countries.

INTERLUDE

_You’re doing great, Dear Reader of these Terms. Let’s rest a moment, shall we? You’ve earned it. So far, so good, right? Everything pretty clear? Well, don’t get too comfortable. Now’s the time to activate the full Galactic Armada of your vocabulary comprehension and ALL CAPS READING SKILLS. What follows are several sections of heavily lawyered-up provisions that we would love to express in a more human-readable, less legal manner. But their form and substance has evolved over time, often via brutal, hand-to-hand litigation or not-to-be-ignored authoritative rulings from courts and interpretations by agencies. This gives us little flexibility in the wording, at least if we want to avoid being laughed out of court in some Doomsday scenario that neither of us even wants to think about. So these following provisions are important, you should read them carefully, and we apologize for the excruciating lawyerly patois._

Warranty Disclaimer. Services Available on an "AS-IS" Basis

Your access to and use of Medium Services or any Content is at your own risk. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT MEDIUM SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MEDIUM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER MEDIUM NOR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER. (B) LOSS OF: PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES. (C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE MEDIUM SERVICES. (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR USER USING MEDIUM SERVICES . AND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT MEDIUM HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND FURTHER EVEN IF AND WHEN A REMEDY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT HAS FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF MEDIUM AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S).

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THE LIMITATIONS ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**Legal Disputes**

You and Medium agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or Medium Services in accordance with this Section or as you and Medium otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to litigation, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution.

**Choice of Law for Legal Disputes:** This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply in any way to these Terms or to the transactions contemplated by these Terms.

**Where a Lawsuit Must Occur:** The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights will be the state and federal courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California. You and we both waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in those courts.

**Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action:** You acknowledge and agree that you and we each waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding against the other.

**Binding Agreement to Arbitrate with Limited Exceptions:** You and we each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

**Waiver of Class Action Arbitration:** Unless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If the previous sentence is held to be unenforceable, then the remaining paragraphs of this Section on Legal Disputes relating to arbitration are void.

**Arbitration Rules:** The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect, except as modified by this dispute resolution section. (The AAA Rules are available here.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

**Arbitration Process:** A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

**Arbitration Location and Procedure:** Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county, city or municipality where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

**Arbitrator’s Decision:** The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration.

**Arbitration Fees:** Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
