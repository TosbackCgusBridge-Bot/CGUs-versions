We may share your peronally-identifiable information, including your name, address, e-mail address, as well as a record of any transaction you conduct on our website or offline with us with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partner will make the data we provide anonymous.
