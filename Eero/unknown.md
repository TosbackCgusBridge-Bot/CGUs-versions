(“eero”) has designed a home WiFi system, consisting of a combination of WiFi network hardware devices (“eero Device(s)”) and eero Device software that can be accessed via the eero mobile application (the “Application”). This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data (defined below) collected via the eero Devices, eero Application and the online services that we provide to users of eero Devices and eero Application(s) (“Services”, and together with the eero Devices and the Application, the “Products”)).

We provide additional details about how we collect and use information from our public web sites in our Privacy Policy for eero Web Sites.

Our Privacy Promise:

*   We will be clear about the different types of information we collect and how we use them.
    
*   We will ask your permission before sharing your personal information with third parties for purposes other than at your request or to provide the Services.

2.  A note about children
    
    The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) regulates the collection of data about children under the age of 13 who are accessing a website or other Internet application. Although the eero Plus portion of the Products are designed to support families with children of all ages, the administration, configuration, and management of the eero Devices and Services (e.g. via the Application) is intended for use by adults over the age of 18. We do not require any information regarding minor children in order to manage eero Devices or provide the Services. We offer the opportunity to create profiles for each user of the Services, including minors. To the extent that a user submits Personal Information about minor children, such information is encrypted in transit. In the event that a child under the age of 13 chooses to use the Products, eero believes that its privacy policy and procedures comply with the requirements of COPPA. If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us at support@eero.com.

In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.
