More from Audi Defining momentsFirst, ignore the rulebook.

For more than a hundred years we've stared adversity in the face. When they said it can't be any lighter, we defied them. When they said it can't go faster, we proved them wrong. Whenever they said it couldn't be done, we simply did it. This is the undying spirit at our core. This is Truth in Engineering.
