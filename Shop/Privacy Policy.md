In general, if you are simply visiting Lenovo’s websites without registering or logging in, you can browse our sites without providing anything other than the non-individually identifying information that our web servers collect automatically. Our web server logs collect the domain names and certain related data of visitors to our websites automatically (such as IP addresses or device identifiers). This information is used to measure the number of visits, average time spent on a Lenovo website, pages viewed and website usage information. We use this information to meet legal or regulatory requirements. to maintain the security and integrity of our websites. to measure the use of our sites. to improve the content of our sites. and to display and inform advertisements.

Lenovo also conducts research on our users' demographics (e.g. age, gender), interests, and behavior based on the information you provide to us when making a purchase, during a promotion, from surveys and from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve you. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis to prevent identification of personal information relating to any one individual. Lenovo sometimes supplements this information with additional data supplied by third parties. Lenovo may share this data with our service providers so that they may provide data hosting, processing, analysis and related services to Lenovo.

Does Lenovo use cookies, tags, web beacons, analytics and related technologies for online advertising and other purposes?

As is true of most websites, we collect certain information automatically and store it in log files. We sometimes collect information about our visitors’ behavior during their visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service, to improve the quality of our website experiences or to deploy advertising.

For example, we keep track of the domains from which visitors come to our website, and we also measure visitor activity on Lenovo websites, but we do so in ways that do not enable the direct identification of any visitor (we call this "non-identifiable information"). Lenovo or others on Lenovo's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics, to improve our websites and to serve advertising.

Clickstreams:

When we collect personal information from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information. This information is sometimes called a "clickstream”. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level.

Cookies &. Online Advertising:

In order to offer and provide a customized website experience, Lenovo may use cookies to store and help track information about you. Where required by applicable law, Lenovo will acquire consent from you prior to using certain cookies during your Lenovo website experience and/or will offer you the opportunity to choose which types of cookies to enable or disable. Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Lenovo uses cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies enable us to save preferences and shopping cart contents for you so you will not have to re-enter them each time you visit.

We also use cookies in order to determine relevant interest-based advertisements to serve the user. For this purpose, Lenovo may use services hosted by companies such as Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting to help us understand our customers' use of our websites and products, and to deliver and manage interest-based advertisements. These services may collect information, such as your IP address, sent by your browser or via cookies.

In addition, cookies and related technologies allow us to measure website trends and traffic patterns, such as which areas of the Lenovo site you have visited and which site you came from. to simplify site navigation. to help design our site in order to make it more efficient and enjoyable. to make product recommendations. and to deliver a Lenovo product advertisement while browsing a website including on non-Lenovo websites.. Lenovo and its service providers , including Google and DoubleClick, use cookies to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to Lenovo’s website. If you do not want to have this information used for serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by following the steps below. You may continue to receive generic ads. Lenovo may also supplement information collected via cookies and related technologies with information acquired from other sources, including third parties.

The use of such cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept them. However, if you prefer not to store cookies, you can choose to:

*   not use our sites
*   set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie
*   set your browser to refuse to accept cookies
*   utilize the cookie consent and control options offered by a Lenovo website (if available and as required by applicable law)
*   delete our cookies after visiting our site
*   browse our site using your browser’s anonymous usage setting (called "Incognito" in Chrome, "InPrivate" for Internet Explorer, "Private Browsing" in Firefox and Safari, etc.)

However, please note that certain Lenovo websites may not respond to Do-Not-Track signals sent by certain browsers. You should also understand that some features of the Lenovo website might not function properly if you do not accept cookies.

If you do not know how to control or delete cookies, or would like to opt-out of receiving certain targeted ads based on your browsing history, we recommend that you visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, https://www.aboutads.info/, or https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ for detailed guidance, including opt-out instructions.

If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and/or opt out of the customized Google Display Network, you may do so by visiting Google's Ads Preferences Manager. You may also wish to utilize the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to opt-out of Google Analytics. For information on how to do this on the browser of your product or mobile device you will need to refer to your browser's or mobile device's help menu or product manual.

Local Storage Objects:

Additionally, some Lenovo website experiences may use local storage objects (LSOs) such as Flash cookies and HTML5 provided by service providers and partners of Lenovo to store content information and preferences on your device. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.

Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-Op:

Certain Lenovo businesses and sites participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Cooperative to better understand how you use certain websites and apps of ours across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions. Learn more about how Adobe does this and how you may opt-out of this program.

Web beacons and other technologies:

Certain website activities may also involve you calling Lenovo or Lenovo, or its repair providers, calling you. Please note that, in some cases, we may record and retain such calls for staff training and quality assurance purposes. If you do not wish the call to be recorded, please notify the call taker.

Business Partner Relationships:

Some Lenovo websites also use web beacons or other technologies such as Java scripts and etags to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Lenovo websites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated. This may be processed by us or by our service providers . These web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you turn off cookies, web beacons and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.

Personalized URL Links:

On occasion, we may personalize and customize websites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Lenovo and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these websites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these websites can be presented as a personalized URL in an email, a notice on a website registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain website.

Does Lenovo sell my personal information?

No. Lenovo does not sell personal information. As described in the sections above, Lenovo may share personal information with third party service providers and partners so that they may support Lenovo’s Products and websites, or to provide additional services to Lenovo and its customers and product users. In doing so, Lenovo takes appropriate steps to ensure that these service providers and partners are meeting Lenovo’s standards of robust privacy and strong security. However, Lenovo does not sell personal information. and we have not sold any personal information during the 12 months prior to July 1, 2020. If Lenovo decides to sell personal information at any point, we would provide appropriate prior notice and consent opportunities as required by applicable law.

Does Lenovo transfer my personal information internationally?

Lenovo is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. Therefore, where permitted by law, we may share your personal information within Lenovo (including to subsidiaries, affiliates and parent companies) or our service providers and business partners and may transfer it to countries in the world where we do business (including, but not limited to, the United States of America and China). Regardless of where your information is transferred to and resides, our privacy and security practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information globally.

Some countries have privacy laws that are not equivalent to privacy laws in your own country and your data could be requested by law enforcement agencies in those jurisdictions. In such countries, Lenovo will still handle information in the manner we describe here and will take such measures as are necessary to comply with applicable data protection laws when transferring and processing your information. Where required, Lenovo will also maintain agreements between Lenovo group companies or with Lenovo partners or service providers to govern the transfer, processing and protection of personal information.

Lenovo uses Standard Contractual Clauses as one means to help effectuate transfers of personal information from and within the European Union and the European Economic Area. In addition, Lenovo’s Motorola Mobility business has established a set of "Binding Corporate Rules" for internal transfers between Motorola Mobility group companies in the European Union and Motorola Mobility group companies elsewhere. These Rules have been approved by certain European Union Data Protection Authorities, and are a commitment by Lenovo and Motorola Mobility to adequately protect personal information they process regardless of where the information resides. A full copy of the Rules can be found here. For further information, please contact privacy@motorola.com.

How long will my personal information be retained?

Lenovo intends to retain information, including personal information, only as long as necessary for business or other compelling purposes. and to securely delete personal information when those purposes of use have been satisfied. We will retain your information, including personal information, for as long as any of the following circumstances apply:

*   your account or subscription is active
*   to provide you with services or support that you may request
*   to ensure required functionality and performance of Lenovo Products and websites, including responsibilities under our product warranties
*   to comply with applicable laws, including for tax and audit purposes
*   to enforce Lenovo’s rights, including litigation and debt collection

How is my information protected?

We use standard technical and organizational measures when we transmit information from our websites to our servers, when we store data, and when we share it with third parties. For example, we use encryption as necessary when transmitting sensitive information to keep your information secure. When sharing your information with third parties, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to contractually require that such parties will protect and use your information responsibly.

**However, please remember that no product, software, or data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.** As a result, while we have taken appropriate steps to protect your information, Lenovo cannot ensure or otherwise warrant the security of Lenovo’s websites or any information you provide to us. By using Lenovo’s websites, you do so at your own risk.

What about my child’s privacy?

Lenovo’s websites are intended for adults and children aged 16 and over, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, who have permission from their parents or legal guardians to use them. Lenovo does not seek to collect personal information about children under the age of 16. Individuals under the age of 16 should provide no personal information to Lenovo.

If Lenovo learns a child under the age of 16, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, has submitted personal information to Lenovo, we will take appropriate steps to delete the personal information as soon as possible and not use it for any purpose. Lenovo encourages parents to take an active role in their children’s use of interactive resources and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing personal information about themselves.

What are my data protection rights?

Applicable data protection laws may give you the right to control our use and processing of your personal information. These may include the right (i) to request access to and a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure of your personal information. (iii) to object to processing of your personal information. (iv) to restrict processing or to opt-out of any sale of your personal information. and (v) to data portability. Where we are using your personal information with your consent, you also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, though this will not affect our uses of your personal information prior to the withdrawal of your consent.
