Privacy

Thank you for visiting https://seekingalpha.com (together with all other websites and services operated by or on behalf of Seeking Alpha Ltd., the "Site"). Your privacy is important to us.

This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use.

Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.

1\. Introduction

We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.

If you are a registered user, you will have your own Seeking Alpha email account ("Seeking Alpha Email Account"). By using your Seeking Alpha Email Account, you may send messages to and receive messages from other registered users and contributors. You are strictly prohibited from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertisements, spam, chain letters, etc. Any information that you send within such a message is visible only to the message recipients. Please note that some actions you take, such as replying to a topic, posting comments, etc. may subscribe you automatically to getting notifications to your Seeking Alpha email account. Please further note that some notifications, such as a notification for receiving a private message to your Seeking Alpha email account, may be enabled by default.

We may use your email address and Seeking Alpha email account to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our services, and those of our advertisers who may have relevant offers.

You may choose not to receive email from a particular sender by rolling your mouse over the text of an email in your Seeking Alpha email account and blocking that sender. If you receive the email from Seeking Alpha in an email account other than your Seeking Alpha email account and wish to block that sender, simply go into your Seeking Alpha email account and block that sender in the same way. Furthermore, if you do not wish to receive email from one of our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving further email from that advertiser.
