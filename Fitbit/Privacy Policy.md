Press Enter to submit Tap to search Privacy Let's talk about privacy.   This is important. We want to highlight for you some key parts of our privacy policy in one quick summary.       WE PLEDGE TO RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY.   We believe in being transparent about our data practices. We work hard to keep your data safe. We give you settings to control how your information is shared, and we only ask you for your information so we can provide you with great products. Our business is to sell products you believe in. We never sell your personal data. We make data work for you so you can live a healthier, more active life.  

If you want more information, you can peruse our full privacy policy. And, if you have questions about this policy, or about our use of your information, please contact us at privacy@fitbit.com.

    INFORMATION WE COLLECT

From motivational sayings to fitness tips, we think it’s important to collect things that make us better. That’s why we collect data when you use our products and services—because that information helps us get to know you and create a better experience for you. And you deserve the best.

**Device Info**

We get your info to give you info. When you use a Fitbit device, we collect data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. So, then we can show you your stats and progress.

**Your IP Address**

When you visit our site, we collect your IP address and can use it to make sure you’re getting the content that’s relevant to you and your location.

**Cookies**

Our policy on cookies—in life, and online—is that we like them a lot, in moderation. When you visit our site, we use cookies and other technologies to improve what we do and how we do it. Get more details in our Cookie Use statement.

**Friends**

You can invite friends to join you on Fitbit by providing us with their email. We’ll use the contact info you provide to send them an invitation to join you and promise not to add them to a marketing list.

**GPS and Location**

Some features, like mapping a run or activity, use precise location data. This includes GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. But we’ll only collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location.

**Account Info**

Everything’s better when it’s tailored to you. That’s why we require info like your height, weight, gender, and age when you create a Fitbit account. It helps us personalize your daily exercise and activity stats like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled.

**Your Contact Info**

We’ve tried, but we just can’t get the psychic thing down. So, when you contact us for help, we collect your name, contact information, and message to make sure we get you the answers you need.

**Purchase Details**

When you buy from our online store, we keep your shipping address so we can fulfill your order. And because you’d be bummed if your new tracker went to someone else. But we don’t store your payment information. And if you make payments using a Fitbit device that supports them, we don’t store your transaction history.

**Linked Account Info**

You can connect your Fitbit account to your accounts on other services, like Facebook or Google. If you do, the other service may send us info like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You can stop sharing this info with us by removing our access to the other service.

  HOW WE USE INFORMATION

We're in the fitness business. So we use personal information to provide you with the best experience possible and to help you make the most of your fitness.

**To get smart** 

We use your information to be more accurate about your daily exercise and activity stats and to personalize the services to help you reach your exercise and activity goals. 

**To protect you** 

We use data to promote the safety and security of our users, other parties, and our products and services. For example, to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, and enforce our terms and policies.  

**To stay in touch** 

We use your contact info so we can send you notifications, allow other Fitbit users to add you as a friend, and—if your account settings allow it—to inform you about new features or products we think you might like.

**To do better** 

We use data to improve our products and services and research and develop new ones. For example, to provide customer support, troubleshoot and protect against errors, conduct research and surveys, and develop new features and services. 

  HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED 

We never sell your personal data. And we only share it when you tell us to, to companies that provide services to us, and for legal reasons or to prevent harm.

**Non-Personal Information** 

We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. For example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services. 

**Personal Information**

We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described in our privacy policy like when you agree or direct us to share the information, or when the information is shared for external processing, for legal reasons, or to prevent harm.  

  WAYS YOU CAN SHARE YOUR DATA 

This fitness journey is yours. That’s why Fitbit gives you settings and tools to control how you share your information—whether you’re connecting with friends and family to get motivated, showing your health stats to a trainer, or using other apps to help you stay on track.

**Making Your Profile and Stats Public** 

Sometimes you feel like sharing, sometimes you don’t. Adjust your privacy preferences in account settings to your liking.  

**Using Community Features** 

You can use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. Just remember that if you choose to participate in a challenge, information like your profile photo, posted messages, total steps in the challenge, personal stats, and achievements, is not governed by your privacy preferences and will be visible to all other challenge participants. Because you’re a boss and other people should know that about you.  

**Using Third-Party Apps or Participating in an Employee Wellness Program** 

You can choose to share your information with a third-party application when you give it access to your account, or with your employer when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. 

Serving up another batch of info. And this time, it’s cookie-related.

Our policy on cookies—in life, and online—is that we like them a lot, in moderation. We use cookies and other technologies to improve our services and your experience.
