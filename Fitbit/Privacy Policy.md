2.  We will be transparent about our data practices and will explain them in clear language;
3.  We will never sell your data, and will only share personally identifiable data when you direct us to (or under the circumstances outlined in our Privacy Policy).
4.  We will always take the security of your data seriously.

Fitbit Privacy Policy **August 10, 2014**

Fitbit designs products and tools that track everyday health and fitness to empower and inspire users to lead healthier, more active lives. This privacy policy applies to our personal fitness and electronic body monitoring products (“Devices”), our websites located at www.fitbit.com, corporate.fitbit.com, dev.fitbit.com, community.fitbit.com, and help.fitbit.com (individually a “Site” and collectively “Sites”), the Fitbit Connect software (“Software”) and Fitbit mobile applications for iPhone OS and Android OS (each an “App” and together the “Apps”). The Devices, Sites, Software and Apps are collectively referred to in this privacy policy as the “Fitbit Service”.

Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you achieve your fitness goals, this policy may change over time. If any modifications substantially change your rights under this policy, we will send you an email where possible, and always provide notice on the Site.

And remember, we’re here to help. If something in this policy does not make sense or if you have any questions, please contact us.

What Data Does Fitbit Collect? When You Activate a Fitbit device

When activating a Fitbit device, you will be asked to download the Fitbit App or install Software and enter information about yourself, such as height, weight and gender. We use this information to determine your personalized fitness stats– for example, calories burned and distance traveled. Depending upon the specific Device you use, it can collect the number of steps you take, your weight, measure your sleep quality and transmit this data to Fitbit. To see the full list of data that your Device collects, visit our Product Specifications page.

When You Create a Fitbit Account

If you want to access data collected by your Device from the Fitbit App, you must create a Fitbit account. When you create a Fitbit account, we ask for some personal information, including your email address and date of birth. You will also have the option to create your Fitbit account using a different credential like your Facebook or Google+ account. If you choose to do so, we will ask permission to access basic information from that account, like your name, profile picture, and friend list. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing Fitbit’s access to that account. We will access your phone’s contact list for the purpose of letting you identify contacts who are Fitbit users. We do not store your phone’s contact list, and it is deleted immediately after it is used for this purpose.

When You Add Information to Your Account

You can customize your Fitbit experience by adding other types of information to your account, such as by adding a food log or by setting an alarm, personalizing your profile with photos, participating in discussion boards, or sending messages to your Fitbit friends. Whenever you add this type of data, we collect it and store it with your other account information.

When You Visit a Site

Fitbit collects some data from everyone who visits our website— even if you don’t have a Fitbit account.

Whenever you visit a Site, we collect industry standard log data that records information about your visit, such as your browser type, operating system, the URL of the page that referred you, the different actions you performed, and the IP address from the pages you visited. We use this type of information to provide you with information that’s relevant to your location and to make sure the Site is working properly. We also collect data from cookies. To see the full list cookies we use and how we use them, please read our Cookie Policy.

When You Sync Your Device

When you sync your device, data about your activity is transferred from your device to our servers. This data is stored and used to provide the Fitbit Service. Each time a sync occurs, we also log data about the transmission. Some examples of the log data are the sync time and date, device battery level, and the IP address used when syncing.

When You Make Purchases From Our Store

If you are logged into your Fitbit account when you purchase something on our site, we associate that order with your account. We also store your shipping address so we can process your order through our fulfillment partner. We do not, however, view or store your credit card information. This is handled by our third-party payment processor. If you are not logged into your account at the time of purchase, we do not associate that data with your Fitbit account, however we save the data so that we can provide customer service related to the purchase.

When You Contact Us For Help

Whenever you contact Fitbit for help, we collect your name and email address along with any additional information you provide in your request and store it on our servers in order to provide you with customer service and to improve the Fitbit Service. If you contact us when you are already logged in to your account, the web form automatically pre-fills in certain information, so you don’t have to type it manually. You can also contact Fitbit through public forums such as Twitter or Facebook. however, we cannot maintain the privacy of your communication to us if you contact us through these channels.

When You Add Friends

To help you stay motivated on your fitness journey, Fitbit lets you add friends who are already Fitbit users or invite friends who have not yet joined. You can add friends in several ways, such as by providing their email addresses, by accessing social networking accounts such as Facebook, or from the contact list on your phone. When you share your friends’ contact information with us to add them as a friend, we will only use it for this purpose. We do not store your phone’s contact list, and it is deleted immediately after it is used for this purpose.

When You Activate Location Features

Location features such as mapping are only available if you activate them. When active, Fitbit collects data like GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs to determine your specific location. We store this information along with your other account information in order to provide you with location features. If you are using a mapping feature, we will send your location information to our mapping service provider so they can display your location on a map. They are contractually prevented from sharing or using this data for any other purpose. You can deactivate these features at any time and Fitbit will stop collecting this type of information.

How We Use Your Data

Data That Could Identify You
