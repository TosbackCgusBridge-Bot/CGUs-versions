LinkedIn in Microsoft Applications with Your Personal Account

LinkedIn and Microsoft have made it possible to access your LinkedIn network from within Microsoft apps and services, and use data from your Microsoft account to improve your experience on LinkedIn. For example, you can now see LinkedIn insights and profiles of many LinkedIn members, or invite others to connect, within applications like Outlook.

_Note:_ These features will be gradually rolled out to our members and may not be available to everyone at this time. This information pertains to connecting your LinkedIn account to your _Microsoft personal account_ only. Learn more about connecting LinkedIn and your Microsoft work or school account.

_What data is included?_

When you connect your LinkedIn and Microsoft personal accounts, you allow LinkedIn to provide the following data to Microsoft to be accessed, stored, and used in accordance with Microsoft's Privacy Statement:

*   _Profile data_ - includes your LinkedIn identity, contact information, and the information you share with others on your LinkedIn profile.
*   _Interests data_ - includes your interests on LinkedIn, such as people and topics you follow, learning interests and recommendations, your groups, and content you like and share.
*   _Subscriptions data_ - includes your subscriptions to LinkedIn applications and services.
*   _Connections data_ - includes your LinkedIn network, including profiles and contact information of your 1st-degree connections.

Connecting your LinkedIn and Microsoft personal accounts also allows Microsoft to provide the following data to be accessed, stored, and used by LinkedIn in accordance with LinkedIn's Privacy Policy:

*   _Profile data_ - includes your Microsoft account information, your photo, and contact information.
*   _Calendar data_ - includes the meetings in your calendars, their times, locations, and attendees.
*   _Interests data_ - includes your interests based on your activities in Microsoft apps such as Cortana and Bing.
*   _Subscriptions data_ - includes your subscriptions to Microsoft applications and services.
*   _Contacts data_ - includes your contact lists in Outlook, Skype, and other Microsoft account services. Your contacts will be periodically imported, stored, and used by LinkedIn, for example to suggest connections, help you organize your contacts, and show you updates about your contacts.

_How is your data used?_

The LinkedIn data you share with Microsoft is used to customize the experience within Microsoft apps and services for you and other users. For example, you can gain insights on things you have in common with others, like that you attended the same school, without having to leave some Microsoft apps or services and go to LinkedIn. Or, when communicating with a colleague in Outlook, you can easily see if you and that colleague share a common connection on LinkedIn.

The Microsoft data you share is used to customize the LinkedIn experience. For example, LinkedIn may suggest that you connect to some of your Microsoft contacts.

_Your control_

If you want to stop sharing data, you'll need to remove data sharing permissions by disconnecting your accounts. Disconnecting from either LinkedIn or Microsoft will have the same effect.

To disconnect and remove data sharing permissions from your LinkedIn account:

1.  Click the _Me_ icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.
2.  Select _Settings &. Privacy_ from the dropdown.
3.  Under the _Partners and services_ in the _Account preferences_ section, click _Change_ next to _Microsoft_.
4.  Click _Remove_ next to _Connect with your personal Microsoft Account_.

To disconnect and remove data sharing permissions from your Microsoft personal account:

1.  Navigate to https://accounts.microsoft.com and sign into your Microsoft account.
2.  Click _Privacy_.
3.  Under _Other privacy settings_, click _Apps and services that can access your data_.
4.  Click _LinkedIn_.
5.  Click _Remove these permissions_.

Learn more about disconnecting your LinkedIn and Microsoft accounts and managing your data.

_Important_: Contacts that have been imported to LinkedIn from your Microsoft personal account will persist on LinkedIn until you remove them. Learn more about managing your imported contacts.

_Note:_ If your LinkedIn settings allow it, your public profile will still be visible in Microsoft applications after you disconnect your accounts. LinkedIn members can control how their profile is viewed through LinkedIn privacy settings, including whether their profile can be viewed in Microsoft applications. Learn more about the visibility of your LinkedIn profile.
