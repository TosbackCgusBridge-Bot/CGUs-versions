Privacy Policy

At the British Library, _we_ care about the privacy of the people who use _our Services,_ and this _Policy_ explains how _we_ deal with _your personal information_ in relation to _our Services._

_We_ explain many of the terms used in this _Policy_ on _our_ Definitions page – defined terms are shown in italics.

Depending upon _your_ relationship with _us, we_ may also provide you with additional _Service_ specific information about _our_ use of your _personal information_ which should be read alongside this _Policy._ Specific details relating to _our Services_ can be found on the Our Services page.

**1.            What type of information does the British Library collect about you?**

1.1          _We_ may collect certain _personal information_ which (either on its own or when combined with other information _we_ hold about _you_) allows _us_ to identify _you_ as an individual and which is about _you_. _You_ can see details of the types of _personal information_ _we_ may collect on the Personal Information page.

1.2          _We_ will normally collect _personal information_ directly from _you_ when _you_ volunteer it to _us_ or from _your_ use of _our Services_. Normally, _we_ try to limit _our_ use of information which allows _us_ to identify you as a named individual to the details _we_ need to provide the requested or agreed _Service_ for _you_.

1.3          Where possible, _we_ collect and use details which do not identify you as a named individual, such as website usage information, aggregated information and statistics and other details of how _you_ use _our_ online content and _Services_. Some of this information may involve the use of cookies and web beacons. Please see the **Depersonalised &. Anonymous Information** section below, as well as our Cookie Policy for more information.

1.4          However, _we_ may also collect information from and/or combine _your personal information_ with information from other sources. _We_ only do this where lawful to do so and where it helps the Library to provide efficient, relevant Services to _our_ users. _You_ can find more details about other such sources on the Data Collection page.

1.5          _We_ do not normally collect any _sensitive personal information_ from or about _you_ and do not wish to do so unless essential. _You_ can find more details about such situations on the Personal Information page.

1.6          _We_ may store _your personal information_ in electronic and/or hard copy format.

1.7          To understand why _we_ collect and further use _your personal information_ please see the **Why does the British Library use your personal information** section below.

**2.            How does the British Library collect your personal information?**

2.1          The _Policy_ applies to any _personal information_ _we_ collect through _our data collection media._ See the Data Collection page for more details.

2.2          _We_ collect _your personal information_ through _our data collection media_ whenever _you_ use any of _our Services_.

**3.            Why does the British Library use your personal information?**

3.1          The _Library_ may use _your personal information_ for a variety of purposes, depending upon the _Service_ you have requested or are using. This will normally simply be to do what _you_ have requested, such as to deal with _your_ enquiry, give _you_ access to the _Library_, provide a requested book to _you_, or send _you_ tickets to an event.

3.2          Other uses of _personal information_ will be to ensure that the _Library_ can meet its legal, regulatory and good governance obligations (and regulator’s expectations), such as meeting audit requirements.

3.3          In addition, where agreed with _you_, _we_ may tailor _our_ communications and dealings with you to better reflect _your_ needs and preferences, such as sending you newsletters with _your_ preferred topics highlighted, or to inform _you_ that _our_ shop offers a book relevant to an event you are attending, or to make you aware that an event similar to one recently attended by you is being scheduled.

3.4          More details about why _we_ use _your personal information_ can be found on the Purposes page.

3.5          The Purposes page is not intended to be exhaustive and may be updated from time to time in line with the _Library_’s business needs and legal requirements.

3.6          _We_ may also convert _personal information_ into depersonalised (“pseudonymous”) data or anonymous data and use it (normally on an aggregated statistical basis) for research and analysis to improve _our_ Services, processes and performance. For more information, please see the **Depersonalised and Anonymous Information** section directly below.

3.7          In carrying out the above, the _Library_ processes _your_ personal data in a variety of ways, each of which may have a different legal basis. _We_ may process _your_ personal data because:

*   _You_ have given your consent (e.g. for the provision of marketing correspondence)
*   It is necessary for the performance of a contract with _you_ (e.g. the purchase of tickets or other goods or services)
*   _We_ are under a legal obligation to do so (e.g. for equality monitoring or health &. safety purposes)
*   It is in the public interest and in the performance of _our_ official duties (e.g. the provision of access to, and the security of, _our_ Collections as set out in the British Library Act 1972)

**4.            Depersonalised and Anonymous Information**

4.1          Depersonalised or aggregated information does not personally identify _you_. It may be used for statistical analysis and administration, including analysis of trends, carrying out actuarial work, tailoring products and _Services_, risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to _our Services_.

4.2          _We_ may automatically collect certain information from you (such as usage information) when _you_ use _our data collection media,_ through the use of web beacons, device identifiers, pixel tags, cookies and similar technologies. _We_ may combine this information with other _personal information_ that _we_ have collected from or about _you_ in order to learn more about how _you_ use _our data collection media_ and _Services_ so that _we_ can improve _our Service_ offering.

4.3          To find out more about how _we_ collect and use this automatically collected information, please see _our_ Cookies Policy.

**5.            Does the British Library share _personal information_ with third parties?**

5.2          _Your personal information_ may be held by _us_ in one or more customer relationship management or CRM database(s), consolidating details of _your_ dealings with the _Library_ across various Services, to ensure _we_ have clear and accurate records about _your_ use of _our_ Services, to better understand _your_ requirements and how _we_ might provide other _Services_ to _you_.   For instance, the _Library_ may assess _your_ attendance at events, against _your_ purchases from _our_ shop, in order to consider making you aware that event specific products may be purchased from our shop.

**Please note:** Details relating to the specific Collection Items that you have requested during _your_ use of _our_ Collections (for example through use of _our_ Reading Rooms or _our_ remote _Services_ such as Document Supply) will never be used to provide marketing analysis or similar functions.

5.3          In addition, the _Library_ makes use of expert third party service providers to help it to provide relevant _Services,_ such as expert IT providers helping the Library with _our_ IT systems, or professional auditors_._ These third party service providers may use _your personal information_ in order to provide the agreed _Service_ to the _Library,_ or to _you_ on _our_ behalf. Please note that certain individuals who will see _your personal information_ may not be based at the _Library_ or in _your_ country (please see **below**).

5.4          _We_ may share _personal information_ within the Library’s advisory boards, panels and councils as needed for reasonable management, analysis, planning and decision making, including in relation to taking decisions regarding _our Service_ offering, order or customer request fulfillment.

5.5          Where thought necessary by the Library, in limited cases, your _personal information_ may also be shared with other people and organisations outside the _Library_ to the extent permitted or required by law (for example, to meet legal obligations on the Library, or to provide reasonable voluntary cooperation with a relevant police investigation), as further described on the Sharing Your Personal Information page.

**6\.            Will the British Library send your personal information overseas?**

6.1             You should be aware that the recipients of _your personal information_ (as set out in this _policy_) may be located in countries or territories outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) which may not have data protection laws equivalent to those in the UK.

6.2             Where _we_ (or our third party service providers acting on _our_ behalf) transfer _your_ _personal information_ to countries outside of the EEA, _we_ will put in place such other measures as are required by law to ensure that those transfers are adequately protected.

**7.               What are your choices relating to contact from us?**

7.1          We may contact you with information that may affect your use of a service, for example, disruptions to services, reading room closures, lost property, or problems with orders, or to request your feedback in relation to those services. Administrative e-mails may also be sent automatically following certain actions, for example, welcome e-mails when you register for a service. Please note that you will not be able to unsubscribe from administrative and service-related communications unless you unsubscribe from the relevant services.

7.2 _We_ may wish to provide _you_ with information about new Services, including products, events, courses, collections, promotions and offers from the _Library_ which may be of interest to _you_, and _we_ may invite _you_ to take part in market research. _We_ may contact _you_ by email (or in some cases by mail) to tell _you_ this information, but _we_ will obtain _your_ consent before contacting _you_ with “direct marketing_”_ in this way.

7.3          _We_ will ensure that any direct marketing communications that _you_ receive from the _Library_ provide a simple way for _you_ to decline or change your mind about further marketing. For example, in emails the _Library_ may provide _you_ with an ‘unsubscribe’ link, or an email address to which _you_ can send an opt-out request. The _Library_ will take steps to stop any direct marketing to which _you_ object, or in respect of which _you_ withdraw _your_ consent, within a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for the change to be administered after being told of _your_ objection or withdrawal of consent.

7.4             If _you_ tell _us_ that _you_ no longer wish to receive the _Library’s_ direct marketing communications _we_ will take steps to respect _your_ modified direct marketing preferences and will keep a record of _your_ request so as to avoid contacting _you_ again in the future with direct marketing content.
