The Free File Fillable Forms program has closed for this year. Come back on January 20, 2015, to file your 2014 federal tax return. The program operates from January through October 20 each year. From October 16-20, Free File Fillable Forms remains available only for correcting and e-filing rejected returns and for printing copies of returns.

  
After October 20, you will not be able to access your Free File Fillable Forms account or the associated tax return information.

**We cannot help you access your Free File Fillable Forms account after October 20.**

If you were not able to successfully e-file your return but printed a copy, mail it in. If you do not have a copy to mail, you will have to prepare another. Return to Filing Your Taxes to find other e-file options.
