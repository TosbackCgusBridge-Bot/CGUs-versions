The Free File Fillable Forms is closed. Come back on January 20, 2015, to file your 2014 federal tax return. 

When the program opens on January 20, 2015 you can establish a new account to file your 2014 federal tax return. You cannot access your prior tax return information (tax years 2013 and earlier).

The program operates from mid January through October 15 each year. After October 15, each year, all Free File Fillable Forms account information is erased from the servers. 

**We cannot help you access your Free File Fillable Forms account after it has been erased.**
