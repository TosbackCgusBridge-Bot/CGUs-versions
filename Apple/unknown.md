    U.S. National Security requests seek customer data in response to national security related investigations. National Security requests include orders received under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) and National Security Letters (“NSLs”). To date, Apple has not received any orders for bulk data.
    
    Apple reports national security requests received for Apple users/accounts (NSLs and orders received under FISA) within bands permissible by law pursuant to the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 (“USA Freedom”). Though we want to be more specific, these are currently the ranges and level of detail permitted under USA Freedom for reporting U.S. National Security requests.
